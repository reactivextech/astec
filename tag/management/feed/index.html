										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are tons of materials from multiple experts and gurus, who promise to teach businesses to inspire their teams, to make the employees grow and become more productive. However, their methods rarely work. Why so? We describe our vision of why conventional employee engagement practices fail, and how to really inspire the employees to self-development.</p>
<p><span id="more-5667"></span></p>
<p>Employee burnout is the biggest problem for every business nowadays. 40 years ago the effort and investment needed to obtain the education were too large to alter the choice of occupation. If one was graduated as an accountant, chances that they would ever drastically change their occupation and become an architect were slim, per se. They could have grown to Heads of Accounting or any other close-related area, but their career was pretty straightforward by default.</p>
<p>Things change nowadays when digital technology helped to tremendously simplify access to knowledge. Anybody can become a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14683506" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">self-educated software developer hired by Microsoft</a>, can get <a href="https://www.class-central.com/collection/ivy-league-moocs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">certifications from Ivy League colleges</a> through their online courses or <a href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MicroMasters degrees</a>. Anybody can pursue their dreams of best job and change their occupation any time if they invest enough effort. This is why many <a href="https://opportunity.linkedin.com/stories" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn stories</a> tell wondrous accounts of people who worked for dozens of companies across 5-6 industries, before finding the best fit for them.</p>
<p>This means the business must devote significant effort to retain the talent acquired, and providing ample opportunities for self-development is generally considered the best approach to this task. If you google “<a href="http://time.com/money/5047491/the-100-best-places-to-work-in-2018/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">100 best companies to work for</a>” or any industry-related search alike, you will not be surprised that most of the employee reviews mention that these businesses make their best to ensure their employees stay motivated and constantly grow.</p>
<h2>A great business should be a boot camp, not a sweatshop</h2>
<p>All human beings are seeking gratification in one form or another. The work must be rewarding in order to remain to be interesting — and be done well. The rewards we talk are not the wages the men need to pay their bills, not the “best employee of the month” badges or diplomas to be thrown away next month. Paychecks alone don’t ensure loyalty, as someone can always offer more. Rewards must gratify the worker’s achievements and motivate them to always strive for more. Otherwise, any occupation becomes a mundane task of repetition.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5670" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ItSvit_company-inspire-self-development-in-employees_text_2-100-min.jpg" alt="IT Svit Blog: Inspiring self-improvement in employees - achievements" width="1338" height="700" /></p>
<p>There are multiple learning and development programs and approaches, but I think the best approach to motivation was shown by <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Simon Sinek in his Golden Circle TED</a> and written by Ayn Rand in her eyes-opening trilogy “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Atlas Shrugged</a>”.</p>
<p><b>Only a truly-earned award is rewarding. Only an appraisal achieved for delivering great work is valuable. Only when a person lives according to a moral code that rewards effort and fulfillment, they can foster self-esteem and congratulate themselves on a work well done.</b></p>
<p>Thus said, how can the management acquire this level of dedication and motivation from their staff? Only leading by example. When the managers live by the code they preach and give their best effort to achieve the set business goals, to help the team become more experienced and efficient, to handle the unexpected tasks with precision and solve workplace conflicts with understanding — only such leaders inspire their teams to work at their fullest capacity.</p>
<p>Quite the contrary, when the leaders procrastinate and avoid taking responsibility — the rewards from them would be considered hypocrisy and have demoralizing, not revitalizing effect on the team. Such a business will become a sweatshop, where the manager demand dedication from employees, while providing none of their own. This is a road to failure, especially in a dynamic world of the 21st century, when people can change their employer with ease and will flock to the companies that treat them as personalities, not as slave labor.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on inspiring your staff</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5668" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ItSvit_company-inspire-self-development-in-employees_Cover_1-100-min.jpg" alt="IT Svit Blog: Inspiring self-improvement in employees - conclusions" width="1338" height="700" /></p>
<p>Thus said, the best way to boost your inspiration and productivity in your personnel is to accept the moral code, where the measure of greatness is the measure of the ability to inspire and lead, to overcome challenges and stay true to your word, to grow as a professional yourself and facilitate growth in your underlings. This is the basis of a strong and passionate team — because the talent will leave in search of recognition otherwise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DevOps continues to gain momentum. This isn&#8217;t exactly news, as the term itself was coined about eight years ago, and prominent companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix have made their share of meaningful donations to its development.</p>
<p><span id="more-5646"></span>Many IT industry influencers believe it&#8217;s no longer a question of <b><em>if</em></b> your organization will adopt these practices, but <b><em>when</em></b>. And yet the DevOps methodology of software delivery is still evolving, as are the tools and technologies that support it. So the question also involves <b><em>what</em></b> you&#8217;ll be adopting and <b><em>who</em></b> will adopt these new tools and workflows. Let’s try to imagine what your DevOps team will look like in 3 years, so you will be better able to adapt to the future today.</p>
<h2>How DevOps came to be</h2>
<p>At first, the software engineer (or system administrator) was supposed to be the jack of all trades. He had to be able of installing, configuring and patching the software, writing the scripts and macros for supporting business IT workflows, even fixing the faulty printer. However, it soon became obvious that such an approach is not feasible, and the great specialization began.</p>
<p>Software engineers were forced to specialize in various professions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Front-end developers,</li>
<li>Back-end developers,</li>
<li>QA and testing engineers,</li>
<li>Website markup developers</li>
<li>Designers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sysadmins had to split also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database administrators,</li>
<li>Customer support,</li>
<li>Level 2 and level 3 support,</li>
<li>Operations engineers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5651 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ItSvit_What-your-DevOps-team-will-look-like-in-3-years_salary_stats.png" alt="IT Svit Blog: What will your DevOps team look like in 3 years - salaries" width="708" height="782" /></p>
<p>However, such siloed responsibilities and tasks had lead to a significant increase in the complexity of the software delivery process. When the teams grew too big, finding out the team member guilty in exceeding the project deadlines became too complicated. This is why the DevOps concept came to be.</p>
<p>The original idea of the DevOps methodology was simply to de-silo Devs and Ops to overcome the bottlenecks in the software development and deployment process, mostly on the ops side. The resulting DevOps engineers had to be able to fix minor code issues during the deployment; readjust the CI/CD pipelines to use the automated unit test codebase; be able to solve customer support requests; be proficient in monitoring and rapidly react to incidents and much, much more.</p>
<p>At first blush, it seems as though the merge would affect only Devs and Ops, but multiple other areas of expertise had to be included, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing and QA,</li>
<li>Data security objectives,</li>
<li>System and data protection,</li>
<li>AI implementation for predictive analytics,</li>
<li>Efficient system monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are top-level concerns of management, and they have become part of the DevOps picture. In other words, when you hear &#8220;DevOps&#8221; today, you should probably be thinking <b><em>DevSecQATestInfoAIOps</em></b>.</p>
<h2>When Agile is not enough</h2>
<p>DevOps approach underpins the Agile software delivery methodology, but it goes far beyond the concentration on cost reduction and shorter time-to-market for new products. Forrester has proclaimed that <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/2018-the-year-of-enterprise-devops/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2018 was the year of enterprise DevOps</a>, as <b>more than 50% of enterprises worldwide have adopted the DevOps practices</b> to enhance their technology value streams. As the value delivery today is largely based on technology, utilizing the available systems and tools in the most efficient way is the key to success.</p>
<p>How to ensure this works? By removing the managerial barriers, so the guys who actually have to introduce the change do not have to ask for permission from managers, whose main concern is stability, not the improvement. This way the DevOps team has a say in the company strategy field and can become the true driver of technological and cultural innovation in the enterprise. Below are the main prerequisites for enterprise DevOps success today:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cultural environment of high trust, where DevOps principles flourish</li>
<li>Infrastructure as Code approach facilitating experimentation with little mistake costs</li>
<li>Extensive usage of continuous system performance assessment, continuous feedback gathering, continuous value implementation, and continuous code deployment pipelines to ensure smooth system operations and proactive issue solving.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The nowadays of DevOps</h2>
<p>Today, with the evolution of DevOps, the goal is supporting a continuous delivery pipeline. Operations department has been adopting so many of the techniques used by developers to support more agile and responsive processes that we&#8217;re seeing a kind of DevOps evolution aimed at further differentiation of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/svit-devops-team-junior-senior-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main DevOps roles</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Site Reliability Engineer or SRE</b> — the DevOps talent specializing in designing resilient, easily scalable and cost-effective infrastructures for your products and services</li>
<li><b>Dev+</b> — a developer able to create and configure Continuous Delivery pipelines, where the build, testing, and staging servers are provisioned automatically, so the ready code is pushed to production without even issuing a request for an Ops engineer.</li>
<li><b>Ops+</b> — an Ops engineer, who knows enough about the app in development and understands its architecture to be able to execute some minor fixes mid-deployment to minimize the release downtime or avoid it altogether</li>
<li><b>DevSecOps</b> — an Ops engineer specializing at weaving the security layers, features and practices into the code, workflows, and pipelines of software delivery</li>
<li><b>AIOps</b> — an Ops engineer specializing at imbuing the AI algorithms into the system monitoring frameworks to enable anomaly discovery and self-healing IT infrastructures, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What about DevOps tools?</h2>
<p>DevOps methodology of Agile software development was greatly empowered by the introduction of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/why-when-and-how-do-we-use-docker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker containers</a>. These are essentially the packages of code with all the required runtime components to launch an app. This technology fairly revolutionized the software delivery process, as the containers allowed to run ANY app on ANY type of infrastructure (from <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/gcp-vs-aws-better-using-kubernetes-terraform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public cloud</a> to <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/vagrant-vs-docker-better-software-development-environments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on-prem virtual machines</a> or <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/metallb-load-balancer-bare-metal-kubernetes-clusters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bare metal clusters</a>).</p>
<p>The second pillar of DevOps transformation was the introduction of 2 immensely powerful DevOps tools: Kubernetes and Terraform. <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/kubernetes-manage-infrastructure-like-giant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes</a> is used to create and manage the virtual clusters for running containerized apps, while <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/what-is-terraform-and-why-it-rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraform</a> enables the simple creation, adjustment, and deletion of the underlying cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Thus said, the Gartner report states that DevOps workflows &#8220;<a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2999017" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">demand a linked chain of tools to enable efficient system operations</a>.&#8221; This toolkit grows steadily, so DevOps engineers have to constantly increase their knowledge and become versatile with various tools to remain competitive. Luckily, this is essentially what DevOps approach fosters — <em>the environment of high trust, where the talents become better</em>.</p>
<h2>The environment of high trust</h2>
<p>DevOps methodology of software development does not concentrate on blaming the one responsible for each particular incident, post-release downtime or database failure that requires backup restoration. Such issues are merely considered indicators of system structure flaws, highlighting the room for improvement.<br />
When the team can discuss the failure freely, it leads to finding the roots of the problem and improving the system performance, instead of finding the guilty person and blaming him. This is why in DevOps environments of high trust the team members exchange the information to help discover and solve the issues faster, which leads to highly motivated teams determined to deliver the ever-increasing stream of value. So to say, the main question is not “<b>whose fault is this?</b>” but “<b>what we learned today?</b>”, so the teams concentrate on improvement, instead of being paralyzed by fear of punishment.</p>
<h2>Using Infrastructure as Code</h2>
<p>Such kind of scenario is possible only when the server infrastructure is versioned as code, through <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/use-terraform-kubernetes-manage-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraform and Kubernetes manifests</a>, Ansible playbooks, Jenkins workers, etc. Long gone are the days when the servers had to be installed, configured and maintained manually according to long checklists.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the infrastructure states can be described in code, stored on Github and versioned, so that the required environment can be rapidly provisioned in the cloud. Due to this approach, the cost of error is negligible in comparison to manually configured dedicated servers. This way, the team is free to experiment and build better infrastructure without being stopped and slowed down on every step by the server provisioning costs.</p>
<h2>The evolution of DevOps practices</h2>
<p>Essentially, the IT industry repeats its previous path. A single DevOps engineer of today cannot cover all the needs of multi-faceted IT operations, hence the differentiation. At the same time, the DevOps teams must evolve their workflows and practices in order to be competitive. Simply automating the majority of mundane operations using Jenkins jobs, Kubernetes manifests and Ansible playbooks is just not enough. Predictive and prescriptive analytics powered by AIOps, leveraging the benefits of ChatOps, designing and implementing the self-healing IT infrastructure — this is the way the IT services evolve nowadays. Below we explain what are these trends and what your DevOps team will look like in three years.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5649" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ItSvit_What-your-DevOps-team-will-look-like-in-3-years_evolution-of-DevOps-100-min.jpg" alt="IT Svit Blog: What will your DevOps team look like in 3 years - info" width="1339" height="700" /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Predictive and prescriptive analytics with AIOps</b>. <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aiops-next-level-devops-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AIOps is the next level of IT services</a>, where <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/predictive-analytics-in-devops-applications-and-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictive analytics</a> and <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/prescriptive-analytics-devops-next-progress-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prescriptive analytics</a> based on AI algorithms are used to predict and prevent issues, rather than monitor the systems and fix the incidents after they occur. This is a much more cost-effective approach compared to staring into the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/5-parts-svit-logging-monitoring-toolkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monitoring tool</a> dashboard, waiting for the hell to break loose.</li>
<li><b>Leveraging the benefits of ChatOps</b>. ChatOps is another arising trend, where important system notifications are not emailed, nor are sent as SMS. Instead, they are delivered to popular messengers like Slack, WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram or others via an API integration with various <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/30-open-source-devops-tools-svit-uses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular DevOps open-source tools</a>. Such messages contain the links to the code branch, GitHub repo, pull request number, automated test, or Jenkins job in question. This context greatly simplifies and shortens the incident solving process and the software delivery routine at scale.</li>
<li><b>Design and implementation of self-healing IT infrastructure</b>. This is really the way the most advanced IT service companies are moving. From the manually configured servers — to virtualization. From virtual machines — to provisioning infrastructure for containerized apps with Terraform manifests. From the predictive analysis of system performance controlled by humans — to fully autonomous <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/create-self-healing-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-healing infrastructure</a> maintained with the AI algorithms and ML models. When the environment is faster to recreate than to repair after failure and the machine learns to prevent such failures with time — this is a whole other level of DevOps workflows.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final thoughts: DevOps services enter another spin of the spiral</h2>
<p>As of now, the variety of roles in the IT industry is steadily growing. Software engineers begin to identify themselves as experts in the domains that did not exist a couple of years ago (like serverless computing or app containerization). This is backed up by constant introduction of new services and features like managed Kubernetes services, serverless computing, distributed cloud databases, AI-powered products and features from AWS, Google, MS Azure and other providers alike.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5647" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ItSvit_What-your-DevOps-team-will-look-like-in-3-years_Conclusions-100-min.jpg" alt="IT Svit Blog: What will your DevOps team look like in 3 years - conclusions" width="1339" height="700" /><br />
However, in about 3 years the DevOps industry will have to combine multiple areas of expertise into more versatile and all-around capable specialists, which will be able to fully utilize the power of AI to enhance their IT operations. This will happen exactly the way it happened when the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/devops-culture-huge-step-mankind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps culture</a> itself was emerging in 2009 — and for the same reasons. All the diverse specialties will have to mix and melt into a new type of software engineer.</p>
<p>To sum it up, it is hard to predict what your DevOps team will be called in 3 years, but we can predict what tools and practices is will have to use to remain competitive. It is high time to invest in ML training for your DevOps engineers, so in a year they will be able to engage into AIOps, ChatOps and begin implementing the self-healing systems for your business. This is the way of future-proofing your business and making sure it remains competitive and lucrative.</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/devops-team-will-look-like-3-years/">What your DevOps team will look like in 3 years</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/10-principles-great-customer-service/">10 principles of great 10 principles of great customer service</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most valuable asset of any business is its team. And the most impactful action of any team is its interaction with your customer. Why is frustration the most frequent result of support calls?</p>
<p><span id="more-5411"></span></p>
<p>The true reason behind this situation will be presented in one of our next articles, discussing what would happen if the IT services companies provided great customer support. In short, the point is that when the IT companies grow, the numbers of support requests outgrow the capabilities of their customer support team at some point, and the solution before was to maximize the number of support requests handled per shift. This leaves little time to deal with an individual request, which means the customers get frustrated quite often.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the IT industry knows about the problem — what steps can be made to correct it? Below are 10 principles of great customer service, supported with real-life examples.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Provide multiple customer service access options</b>, including simple to navigate self-service portals</li>
<li><b>Provide product onboarding video materials</b> to flatten the learning curve</li>
<li><b>Empower the employees to create positive customer experiences</b> by empowering positive employee experiences within the team</li>
<li><b>Provide proactive solutions</b> (not only for the issues the customer requested support with but for more deeper and fundamental challenges and bottlenecks)</li>
<li><b>Foster the creative notions within your team</b>, give them the time to step away from the tickets queue and analyze the whole picture and suggest improvements</li>
<li><b>Actively implement customer feedback</b> and quickly respond to positive and negative reviews</li>
<li><b>Clearly define your company core values</b> and what you stand for so that the customers can align with your principles and associate with the brand</li>
<li><b>Build lifelong relations with each customer</b>. When people feel they are valued, they become brand advocates, and personal advocacy from a friend is the best recommendation a business can get</li>
<li><b>Fix your mistakes at no extra charge</b> and make sure to avoid such situations in the future. Bad memories last long, normal service is not duly noted, only exceptional service gets remembered.</li>
<li><b>Get to know your customers.</b> Mentioning the details of their careers and achievements and going an extra mile to fulfill your promises makes all the difference between a frustrated churn and lifelong brand advocacy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at these principles, and how industry-leading businesses follow them.</p>
<h2>Multiple customer service access options</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-service-benchmark-report/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">customer service benchmark report by SuperOffice</a> highlighted an incredible customer service gap: while<b> 80% of businesses believe</b> they provide excellent customer service, only <b>8% of customers</b> think they receive such a service. Why such a deep chasm?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>2/3rds of companies don’t respond to customer service request emails</b>. They just put the request into backlog and work on solving it. But for a customer, it seems their inquiries go down the drain pipe.</li>
<li><b>9 out of 10 businesses don’t notify the customers of receiving their emails</b>, for the same reason, and with the same results.</li>
<li><b>4/5ths of companies fail to solve the initial request</b> within a single email.</li>
<li><b>97% of businesses don’t follow-up with a service feedback form</b> to ensure the customers are satisfied with the service they received.</li>
<li><b>The average TTR across the IT industry is 12 hours</b>, which is waaaaay too long. This is why <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2018/03/self-service-why-connected-customer-portals-vital" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">according to Salesforce around 60% of Millennials</a> — who form the majority of customers nowadays — prefer self-service portals to emails or phone calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure a phone number or an email address is not the single way of reaching your customer support. To say more, make sure there are clear guidelines on using your products and services freely available to your customers online.</p>
<h2>Product onboarding through video tutorials</h2>
<p>People don’t like reading walls of text. Video information is better to comprehend and memorize, as compared to long instructions. Make sure the key features of your products and services are described in <a href="https://wistia.com/blog/improve-support-using-video" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">easy to grasp product support videos</a>, so your customers can follow the steps to enable a feature or use a function themselves, without any need to contact the customer support, ever. This both reduces the workload for the support reps, who must not answer the same questions for the hundredth time, and fosters customer loyalty.</p>

<p>Empower positive employee and customer experiences</p>
<p>Did you know <b>every Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company employee has a DAILY QUOTA for $2,000</b> for providing EXCELLENT customer experience? Not only an executive manager — a waiter, a room maid or any other lower-rank staff member can exert their powers to deliver stellar customer service. While not every company can issue the same carte-blanche, the approach is a 100% correct one.</p>
<p>Your employees must be appraised and congratulated for forming lasting positive customer experiences, not chided for making a step outside of their responsibilities. Only when every employee knows their extra effort will be appreciated by the company, he or she will deliver this extra effort. The forms of appraisal can differ — from monetary awards to monthly titles, certificates, and diplomas, company-paid trips to seminars and conferences, etc. One such example is a story of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stanphelps/2014/08/01/heroic-customer-service-by-a-senior-executive-at-warby-parker/#4338a794c9fc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how a Warby Parker employee has won a lifetime loyalty of a customer</a> by sending him a pair of reading glasses the latter forgot on a train.</p>
<h2>Provide proactive solutions</h2>
<p>With time and experience, especially after having answered the same question and fixed the same issue for the thousandth time, your customer support reps can go to the problem roots at once. What is even more important, they are most likely able to rectify not only the issue the customer is experiencing at the moment but to remove the core problem, the bottleneck that is causing the issue. The main requirement for this changing the company attitude to measuring support efficiency. Instead of the numbers of tickets processed or calls answered, the success must be measured through the customer feedback forms and ratings.</p>
<p>Such actions should be fostered and facilitated by the company policy, as it is a mutually beneficial feat. The customers get the issues sorted for good, the customer support employees have less headache on their shifts. By automating multiple routine processes and <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/predictive-analytics-in-devops-applications-and-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implementing predictive analytics</a>, the customer support team can free up time for indulging in creative projects, analyzing their work and offering further process improvements.</p>
<h3>Foster the creative notions within your team</h3>
<p>This is the logical consequence of the previous points. Let’s imagine the majority of your customer questions can be answered through self-service portals and with tutorial videos, while the most frequently happening issues are identified and the response scenarios for them are in place. This means your customer support team gets some relatively free time during their shift.</p>
<p>They can devote it to smoking and talking around the coffee machine — or they can indulge in accomplishing their personal projects, like analyzing more areas that can be automated, fostering stronger customer relations through devising personalized solutions for their requests and inventing new ways of improving their working environment. This is actually the self-reproducing cycle of constant strive for perfection, which greatly improves the company culture and team spirit — but it cannot begin on itself, and the management must start it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kikiaards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kristin Aardsma</a>, a customer support employee at Basecamp, shared her story about how the company decided to devote 2 hours a day to improve the internal processes. Basecamp encouraged the employees to start personal projects on gathering the data on the possible ways of improvement, researching and analyzing it and doing the pilot runs to test their ideas. This allowed to drastically lower the employee burnout and helped improve the customer experience, as the staff was more positive and motivated.</p>
<h2>Ask for feedback, respond to it and actively implement it</h2>
<p>The “your call is very important for us” phrase can cause irritation only, and the post-contact survey forms with a request to rate the service from 1 to ten are simply vulgar. The company that really cares about its customer can — and MUST — devote a considerable amount of time and effort to creating engaging and informative surveys, questionnaires, feedback forms, and social media polls. What is even more important, such a company must transform this feedback into new features or improvements quite soon.</p>
<p>For example, the healthy makeup brand Glossier has acted in response to the customer feedback from the very beginning. Its co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/298014" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Emily Weiss has told the Entrepreneur</a> that building new products around the customer’s feedback is the core principle of the company. This ensures every new addition to the product line is well awaited by the customers and their opinions are truly appreciated. In addition, the customers say that the gTeam or the <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/glossiers-gteam-changing-definition-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Glossier support team redefines customer support</a>.</p>
<p>The same principle must be applied to IT services. Monitor the social media and business rating sites for both positive and negative reviews from your customers. Thank for the former ones, inquire for the reason of the latter. Do your best to rectify the situation. Collect the opinions of your customers as to what features must be added to your product or services and align their feedback with your development plans. Seeing that their feedback is valued makes the customers your best brand advocates.</p>
<h2>Clearly define your company core values and stand up for them</h2>
<p>To become your lifelong partners, your customers must be able to associate with your brand on more levels than just using your products and services. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action#t-32609" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Simon Sinek in his speech on the Golden Circle</a> has explained the importance of declaring what your company believes to be right — and standing up to it. This attitude inspires true following and appreciation from your audience, as they are able to say — “I believe these guys do the right thing”, which morally justifies using your products and services and recommending them to their family and friends.</p>
<h2>Build lifelong relations with your customers</h2>
<p>Modern-day Customer Relation Management (CRM) systems enable businesses to stockpile lots of information about their customers. Not only their history of purchases and opened support tickets can be traced, but a ton of data from their social media accounts and other publications can be collected. This can be used to personalize the greeting emails and special offers, as people value most when the vendor spends time and effort to please them.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is acting as if the customer is always right… especially when they are not. The most notorious example of such attitude is the <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/return-to-spender/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">famous fable of Nordstrom tire return</a>. As the story goes, a man walked into a Fairbanks store of a clothing and shoewear vendor and requested a refund for a couple of winter tires, because he was sure he bought them here. Despite the fact that the brand did not sell tires at any point of its history, the return was paid by the clerk. The story has received ample coverage by the press and media and greatly improved the public opinion regarding Nordstrom.</p>
<p>The brand’s real refund policies cannot justify turning it into a dump for unused items sold by other vendors, of course. However, if the refund item is clearly of Nordstrom stock, the refund is paid without requests for any ID’s, cheques, sales slips or other proofs that the sale took place in this particular store. Such an attitude helps win the hearts of the customers and turn them into active advocates of the brand — and it can easily be applied to the IT services industry.</p>
<h2>Fix your mistakes at no extra charge</h2>
<p>Refunds and chargebacks are among the most painful moments in client-business interactions. Both parties are usually sure they are right and both parties refuse to yield. However, if the company turns out to be wrong in the end and is forced to issue a payment, the frustrated customer usually leaves for good and tries to spread the word. As a saying goes, a satisfied customer tells 3 people, a dissatisfied to 3,000. Bad publicity of such sort can be very damaging for the company image and can have a lasting negative impact, so it’s better to fix your mistakes rather sooner than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/technology/05nocera.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon once delivered a parcel when the customer was not at home</a>. The neighbor signed for the delivery and left the parcel at the porch, where it was promptly stolen. Leaving the neighbor’s idiocy aside, the fact that the parcel contained the PlayStation 4 intended as a little boy’s gift for Christmas was bad enough, and the frustrated customer contacted Amazon support service at once. The company delivered a new PS4 the very next day free of charge with apologies. While this happened about 10 years ago, the company has held to the same high customer service standards ever since.</p>
<h2>Get to know your customers well</h2>
<p>We mentioned this briefly in one of the previous points. Modern CRM systems enable the business to collect goldmines of data regarding their customers from a variety of public sources. Applying the Big Data analytics solutions to this data helps better personalize your marketing offers and come up with more detailed conversations while interacting with a customer. Mentioning a recent accolade achieved by the customer’s company or personally, quoting their recent social media post, congratulating them on some important family event — all of this can help form a steady bond and turn a customer into an advocate of your brand.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5414" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ItSvit_10-principles-of-great-customer-service_final.jpg" alt="IT Svit lists 10 principles of great customer service: brand advocacy" width="1338" height="700" /></p>
<p>The reason is the same — people love to be treated personally, not as a generalized pool of customers. For example, Starbucks has recently launched a campaign, where their customers received free latte for introducing themselves to the staff. More than 350,000 coffee cups were given out and the coffeehouse chain received more than 60,000 frequenters, resulting in a decent increase in the company revenues.</p>
<p>The coin has two sides though and digging too deep into personal affairs can have very negative results. When <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-incredible-story-of-how-target-exposed-a-teen-girls-pregnancy-2012-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Target sent discount coupons for baby care products to a father of a high school teen</a>, the outrage of the customer was quite intense. As it turned out, the girl was actually pregnant but did not tell her father just yet. The general notion of the media discussion that followed was that the retail giant should not have used its <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-5-reasons-implement-machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning technology</a> to intrude such an intimate sphere of family life as pregnancy. This marred the company image for several years, despite the project was generally successful and helped millions of customers save money based on the history of their purchases.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on the principles and examples of great customer service</h2>
<p>To sum up the points above, every business must invest a great deal of effort in optimizing their customer support. Keeping the support representatives motivated, automating the mundane tasks, providing the self-service features to please the customers and relieve the personnel — all of these approaches help keep the team spirits high. This, in its turn, means that the customers are treated better and gain lasting positive experiences.</p>
<p>If coupled with a solid product/service quality, this is a basis for the long-term success of your business, where your satisfied customers become your best advocates. Isn’t that the best outcome for any business?</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/10-principles-great-customer-service/">10 principles of great 10 principles of great customer service</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Agile software development methodology was a major improvement over Waterfall, as it provided the means to evaluate the work in progress — iterations. However, changing the way the product is developed makes nearly no difference, if the product is delivered and forgotten. True Agile development is not about delivering an MVP - it is about delivering value, and this process never stops.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/true-agile-value-delivery-never-stops/">The true Agile is a value delivery that never stops</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The software can be shipped by deadlines. In that case, it has some value that does not grow over time. To make the app great, it must be continuously upgraded. This is what the true Agile is about.</p>
<p><span id="more-4174"></span></p>
<p>“The definition of done” is a complex problem for many software development companies. How to know when there are enough features? Is it worth the time to implement a functionality nobody might ever use? How to know if we develop a thing the end users will adore? Do we stop at MVP or should we continue to work on the product?</p>
<p>We think the only correct answer to these questions is following the Agile principles by heart and even more — executing them daily through DevOps workflow.</p>
<h2>DevOps — continuous design, delivery and feedback loops</h2>
<p>The whole concept of MVP and “shipping” the product is faulty today. It worked 20 years ago, when the developers were given 20 pages of Waterfall product specifications, had to meet the deadline and almost never met their software in production. Today we live in a highly-connected world, where software development teams are in nearly constant contact with their customers and even end users, so they face the consequences of their choices immediately.</p>
<p>There are no deadlines for DevOps engineers. Well, not in a traditional sense. They do not ship the software by the deadline and throw it over the wall to be someone else’s concern. They live by “you build it, you run it” principle, so monitoring the software in production is still their personal concern.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4175" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/agile-development.png" alt="Agile Development" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>Truly Agile developers have to provide maintenance, answer customer’s questions and gather feedback on the app’s performance and functionality. Then, they are again the people that process this feedback and have to apply it to designing and provisioning new features, or by adjusting/removing the unnecessary ones. Thus said, the true Agile software development is a continuous design process, followed by continuous feedback loops.</p>
<p>Why is this better? Because this leads to much more than “shipping” a product within the deadline and under budget. This product gets the job done and the team gets paid… and forgets about the product until the next update is needed. Then they get the next task for the next batch of features, complete it on time… and forget about the product once more.</p>
<p>Such an approach is predictable, reliable&#8230; and limited. It excludes iteration, communication, collaboration, permanent purchase of higher efficiency, the feeling of belonging and, ultimately — the customer loyalty. This latter is, undoubtedly, the most valuable part of success for any business.</p>
<p>When the customers see their questions answered, their feedback implemented in new features, their suggestions appreciated — they grow the feeling of being a part of the team themselves, where everyone is a designer. This leads to building a continuously expanding network of value that is not limited to products but incorporates the customer relations.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on the true Agile</h2>
<p>The developers interacted with the end users through the sales representative 20 years ago, via a mobile app today, will be doing this via Alexa or Siri tomorrow … and maybe via an AI in a decade? The point is the developers should be in constant touch with the end users of their products and improve the design continuously.</p>
<p><b>Design. Build. Test. Deploy. Monitor. Gather feedback. Repeat.</b></p>
<p>Sounds familiar? Yes, this is the DevOps paradigm.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4177" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/devops-paradigm.png" alt="DevOps paradigm" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
What about you? Do you listen to your customers? Do you design continuously? Do you want to experience it firsthand? <a href="https://itsvit.com/contacts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Give us a nudge</a> — we can make it work for you!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/true-agile-value-delivery-never-stops/">The true Agile is a value delivery that never stops</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Remote project management is what enabled the IT outsourcing to flourish. The customers are able to attract top talents overseas and compose a geographically distributed team to accomplish the project. This helps the business benefit from the lowered expenses, shortened time-to-market and improved business flexibility in general. However, certain challenges can impede the remote project management process, so today we explain how IT Svit handles this task.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/how-it-svit-handles-remote-management-projects/">How IT Svit handles the remote management projects</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remote project management can provide tangible benefits for any business if it is done right. IT Svit has ample experience with executing the remotely managed projects. Here is how we do it.<br />
<span id="more-3314"></span>We are living in the era of remote collaboration, as technology advancements make it possible to speak to your colleague across half the globe without delay — and commit the code for your mutual project simultaneously. Remote project management enables the whole industry of IT outsourcing when the customer and some part of the team resides in one country (marketing, sales, billing, business analytics, managerial staff) — and the other parts of the team (DevOps, web developers, data scientists) are spread across the globe.</p>
<div id="benefits">Such approach ensures multiple tangible benefits:</div>
<ol>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;"><b>Lower project costs</b>. Outsourced specialists cost less while providing the same (and in case of <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/msp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">top 15 MSP’s worldwide</a> — supreme level of expertise and skills, as compared to an in-house IT team)</li>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;"><b>Decreased time-to-market</b>. Quite often the tasks given in the evening are accomplished overnight, which lowers the software development time significantly.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;"><b>Better work/life balance for the team</b>. Employing experienced specialists increases the chance of timely achievement of the goals set, equally reducing the need for long hours for the rest of the team.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Increased product performance and efficiency</b>. When your product is developed by top-notch professionals, they are able to address all the details from the start. This way, you are able to avoid many hidden challenges altogether and enjoy increased product efficiency and positive end user experience due to built-in product scalability, automated infrastructure provisioning and management, in-depth logging and monitoring solutions, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3315" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Benefits-of-working-with-IT-Svit.jpg" alt="Benefits of working with IT Svit" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<div id="challenges">However, aside from these benefits, remote project management poses certain challenges, which have to be dealt with to ensure a successful execution of a distributed project:</div>
<ol>
<li>Gradual loss of productivity. Without the constant “feeling of the friendly shoulder” quite many IT specialists lose their concentration and the will to continue doing the hard work, no matter how dedicated and devoted to the project they are in the beginning. This is especially true for freelancers, yet might impact the remote project teams as well.</li>
<li>Issues with team member availability due to various location or connection issues. Different time zones might mean the impossibility for the team members to communicate efficiently, the Internet access might be absent sometimes, the team members might have to go on a trip and lose access to their computer, etc.</li>
<li>Cultural and legislative barriers. When the teams work in distant countries they might have different cultural traditions (including religious and state holidays) or have to deal with legislative barriers (like the GDPR or the USA PATRIOT Act).</li>
<li>Communication issues. English is not native for many remote developers, not to mention the difficulties with getting the meaning of the slang expressions, intonations or body language, which might alter the meaning of the conversation significantly. This might quite often lead to miscommunication and affect the project outcome.</li>
<li>Access to technology and data security. The whole team should use the same tools and follow the same practices when using the company resources and data. Otherwise, there is of a bottleneck in product development or a security breach, which might be even more damaging.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3321" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remote-IT-Svit-challenges.jpg" alt="Challenges of remote project management IT Svit deals with" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<div id="counter">IT Svit has ample experience providing <a href="https://itsvit.com/our-services/devops-service-provider/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DevOps-as-a-Service</a>, Big Data solutions, the full cycle of services for startups, web development and QA for such remote projects. We have developed countermeasures for all the challenges mentioned above.</div>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3320 alignleft" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Motivated-and-efficient-team.png" alt="Motivated and efficient team" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>1. <b>A small, motivated and efficient team</b>. Our company forms a team based on the customer’s requests and the technology stack needed. If the PM remains at the customer’s location, our Team Lead assumes the role of Product Owner and helps the team to understand the project requirements in full, provide correct estimates and delegate the tasks appropriately.</p>
<p>Every team member delivers the daily plans in the morning and the daily reports at the end of the day through the project management system. Thus said, both the Team Lead/Product Owner and the remote Project Manager are aware of the project progress, as well as any possible challenges and bottlenecks. This helps the team remain efficient, and solve any issues as soon as possible.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3318 alignleft" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Full-time-employment-and-remote-access.png" alt="Full-time employment and remote access" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>2. <b>Full-time employment and remote access</b>. We employ all our specialists full-time, so they are always available during the business hours. We have 2 backup Internet uplinks should the main office uplink go down, and every team member has a VPN access configured in case they have to come online from home or from a business trip.</p>
<p>Finally, as we are located in Ukraine, our work hours largely intersect with the EU business time and we are able to deliver the results overnight for the US customers.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3316 alignleft" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Culture-and-legislation-compliance.png" alt="Culture and legislation compliance" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>3. <b>Culture and legislation compliance</b>. Our work calendar meets the EU and US businesses schedule almost completely as our religious and official holidays mostly correlate. In addition, our business culture is built after the best examples of US and EU business, which is often mentioned in independent <a href="https://clutch.co/profile/it-svit#reviews" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">5-star reviews on Clutch</a> from IT Svit customers.</p>
<p>We also follow the legislation demands by heart and work according to ITSM/ITIL requirements, under NDA and SLA to ensure our customers are on the safe side.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3317 alignleft" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Direct-and-on-point-communication.png" alt="Direct and on-point communication" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>4. <b>Direct and on-point communication</b>. Our team has ample experience communicating with the customers form the US and EU. We have the extensive knowledge of the business culture and practices of startups, small-to-medium businesses, and enterprises, and we are always able to come on the same page with the customer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT Svit is proud to have polished workflows that help us deliver great products and services on time and under budget. This article highlights the way we do the project management at IT Svit.<br />
<span id="more-3170"></span></p>
<p>Quite often the startups contact us with the same request: they have a great idea, have some seed funding to create an MVP and need a good team to make it real. They often lack the technical background to know how the product must tick, as well as hands-on experience with leveraging the AWS, GCP or Azure infrastructure to maintain the ready app in production. Despite this, we are able to provide the first-class services that ensure the success of our customers’ startups and business goals. This is the project management workflow, done IT Svit style.<br />
<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-3227 size-full" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-analysis.jpg" alt="How to create a high-performance project team: infographics" width="1200" height="1256" /></p>
<h2>Task requirements analysis</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3214" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-analysis.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 1" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>It usually takes us around <b>3-4 weeks</b> to gather the team meeting all the customer’s requirements and expectations of the product features. After that time we clearly understand what the customer WANTS, and what he/she actually NEEDS to get the product up and running quickly. We understand the technology stack and toolkit needed to build and release the MVP or a full-scale product. Knowing this all, we understand what specialists are needed to fill in the roles.</p>
<h2>Creating the product vision</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3222" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-vision.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 9" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>We propose the product architecture and the expected modus operandi of all the components to ensure the stability of operations and ease of management.  By forming a holistic vision of the future product and infrastructure we ensure the customer gets the features he wants along with uninterrupted end user experience. We also provide the list of the specialists needed to get the job done.</p>
<h2>Selecting the appropriate team</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3221" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-team.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 8" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>IT Svit recruiting team uses our product, HRM system, to sift through the profiles of more than 3 thousands of suitable applicants and select the ones most fitting the project specs and most motivated to get the job. These applicants are eager to work with a reputable <a href="https://itsvit.com/our-services/devops-service-provider/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DevOps services provider</a> listed amongst the <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/msp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">top 20 MSP’s worldwide</a> and one of the <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/ukraine/leaders-matrix" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">leaders of the IT outsourcing market</a> in Ukraine according to international business rating and reviews agency <a href="https://clutch.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clutch.co</a>. Our rich experience and correct approach to building the team is often noted by our satisfied customer in their <a href="https://clutch.co/profile/it-svit#reviews" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">5-star reviews</a>.</p>
<h2>Emphasis on soft skills</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3218" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-emphasis.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 5" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>We make a special emphasis on soft skills, as we know their importance by heart. The team must communicate and collaborate to be efficient, so the better the team members are able to work together, the faster the working product will be ready. By paying sufficient attention to soft skills, we ensure the team members are both skilled professionals and good colleagues, ready to devote sufficient effort to ensure the project success.</p>
<h2>Team composition and onboarding</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3219" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-onboarding.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 6" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>We conduct a series of interviews with the candidates at our office and shortlist them for the customer’s convenience. The client gets to choose from several best fits based on our recommendations to ensure the final team will be a good one regardless of the talents engaged. Then the team members approved by the customer go through the quick onboarding process. They get acquainted with the project requirements and expected architecture, so they are able to suggest solutions for potential bottlenecks if need be.</p>
<h2>Project infrastructure delivery and maintenance</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3217" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-delivery.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 4" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Many of our customers have their products deployed on AWS, GCP or Azure, or want their future apps to be deployed to these cloud platforms. These web or mobile apps might be developed using React, Node.js, PHP or Laravel or any other framework. For example, you might already have the iOS / Android/web development teams on site, you will still need the DevOps team to launch the product on the cloud platform and support the further maintenance.</p>
<p>IT Svit houses big and competent DevOps and Technical Support teams to ensure the stable infrastructure operations and timely product support if needed. We specialize in delivering cost-efficient IT infrastructure for companies of all sizes, so our DevOps specialists are able to offer the best solution both to a startup and to a full-size enterprise.</p>
<p>To say even more, almost any project nowadays involves a huge deal of Big Data, Machine Learning (ML) &amp; Artificial Intelligence (AI). As it was announced on the latest <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-summit-2018-london-highlights-takeaways/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS Summit 2018 London</a>, AWS becomes the Big Data &amp; AI-oriented company. To leverage the full extent of the platform possibilities, the businesses should employ Big Data engineers and data architects to be able to provide better customer outcomes. Luckily for our customers, Big Data is another field of expertise of IT Svit and we are ready to deliver the full cycle of services for startups and any other businesses. We can setup Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra, create web crawlers and scrapers, and use any type of ML model to provide precise and valuable business analytics.</p>
<h2>Business trips to get the customer acquainted with the team</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3215" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-business-trip.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 2" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Once the customer approves the team composition, they get to meet each other and establish personal contacts. Either the team goes on a paid business trip to work at the customer’s location for a couple of weeks, or the client visits our office to get a hands-on experience of interacting with the team and clarify the project specs. This is a popular practice in today’s outsourcing workflows, making sure the team is on the same page with the client and his/hers on-site team.</p>
<h2>Polished workflows for every stage of the product delivery</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3223" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-workflow-delivery.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 10" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Once the team begins working seamlessly and returns to the remote work scheme from our office, we follow our polished internal workflows to ensure the timely delivery of required product features. Ample first-hand experience allows us to prioritize the tasks correctly to ensure successful sprint completion. For example, each team member writes the daily plans in the morning and delivers the daily reports in the evening. This helps evaluate the project progress correctly and apply preemptive corrections if need be to ensure timely project completion.</p>
<h2>Daily direct communication with the team</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3216" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-communication.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 3" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Our Team Leads (TL) act as product stakeholders and control the product development process. They inform the customer of the progress with daily direct communications in chats, project management systems (Jira, Trello, Redmine, etc.) or Skype calls. The customer always knows what the team is up to, if any roadblocks emerge and what is being done to overcome the challenges.</p>
<h2>Working ahead of schedule</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3220" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/High-performance-project-team-Our-Success-Story-schedule.png" alt="How to create a high-performance project team 7" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Such approach to project management ensures our teams always deliver the results on time, and quite often deliver ahead of schedule to ensure the customer stays on the safe side. This is proved by multiple <a href="https://clutch.co/profile/it-svit#reviews" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">5-star IT Svit customer reviews on Clutch</a> and the fact that nearly <b>70% of new customers are referred to us</b> by previous satisfied IT Svit clients.</p>
<h2>An example of IT Svit approach to forming a high-performance project team</h2>
<p>Without disclosing any details of the product, we can describe one our recent projects. The team was composed of such professionals:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">AWS Terraform engineer</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">AWS Architect (acting as a Team Lead)</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Python Developer</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">2 Technical Support Engineers</li>
</ul>
<p>The TL was responsible for the product architecture and infrastructure design, as well as choosing the team members and communicating with the customer. As he had a clear vision of how the product should work and what technology should be used, he was able to come up with the list of needed skills and interview the potential applicants.</p>
<p>Such approach to selecting the team has helped us to <b>shorten the time</b> needed for the project launch <b>by 30%</b> and allowed the customer to <b>save around 25% of overall project budget</b>, as we were using the AWS infrastructure efficiently and without unneeded delays. Our team was almost always ahead of schedule and the high-quality product was delivered on time. The customer was completely satisfied and we are now engaged in ongoing development and maintenance of the product.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>It goes without saying that housing a reliable IT team is crucial to ensure the success of any business. However, building such a team is a laborious and time-consuming task. To increase the chances of success you ought to follow this guideline on how to build a great in-house team of developers.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/build-great-house-team-developers/">How to build a great in-house team of developers</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most disturbing and important questions each startup has to answer is how to build a great in-house team of developers. We explain the way it works for us and our customers.</p>
<p><span id="more-3075"></span></p>
<p>The best way to create a good product is by hiring a good team for the job, obviously. However, gathering a good team and making sure they work well with each other is a long and time-consuming process. Losing time is not a luxury a startup can allow, so minimizing the time needed to build a great in-house software development team should be a priority.</p>
<p>Over the course of the few previous articles, we explained the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/hiring-dedicated-software-development-team-vs-building-house/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">differences between working with a dedicated and an in-house team of software developers</a>, the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/5-benefits-dedicated-team-developers-vs-house-one/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">benefits of opting for the dedicated team route</a>, and the peculiarities of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/hire-dedicated-team-developers-startup/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hiring a reliable dedicated software development team</a>. It’s time to explain how we (and our customers) assemble great teams of top-notch talents when they launch their first successful projects. When launching all the next ones, they already have the team at hand, obviously.</p>
<h2>Step 1: It takes an expert to hire an expert</h2>
<p>While you might have a clear understanding of the real world problem your startup product will solve, you are not expected to be a one-man orchestra who knows the front-end development, the back-end development, the QA and testing, the mobile app development for iOS/Android and all the rest of the software delivery pipeline parts. Thus said, you need to find an expert.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3077" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Great-in-house-team-of-developers-consultation.jpg" alt="How to build a great in-house team of developers: consultation" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
Experts in any field have to keep their visibility up. They are present and active on various social media groups, Reddit, Quora, Stack Overflow and other websites. Look for the community members with the biggest authority/ karma/ number of likes, etc. who are related to the field of your interest. Such people are often the participants or even keynote speakers at various conferences, meetups, and other events.</p>
<p>You can address them online or while attending said events and ask for their help or consultation. They might ignore the inquiry, of course, yet the risk of public divulgation of such actions and the possible damage to their reputation will most likely prevent such course of actions. They will quite often either direct you to a suitable candidate or might even apply for the job themselves. Most importantly, they will clarify the potential project requirements and give estimates of the required technology stack and team structure, as well as providing invaluable background for evaluating the skills of your potential employees.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Test a lot, and we do not talk about the software</h2>
<p>You need to make sure your future team leads are A-grade specialists, not C-grade staff. Highly-skilled professionals are aware of their strengths and weaknesses and not afraid of hard tasks or in-team competition. In addition, they will be able to correctly assess the task complexity and delegate appropriate parts to appropriate executants.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3078" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Great-in-house-team-of-developers-hiring.jpg" alt="How to build a great in-house team of developers: email" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
Ask the experts to create the tests to assess the candidates’ skills. Make them technically hard, as you are looking at your future Team Leads and want battle-hardened veterans, not rookies. This will efficiently help to shortlist 3-5 candidates for actual interviews while requiring really little effort on your end. All you need to do is select the person with best soft skills — a good communicator, a confident leader and a diligent executant who will be able to oversee the team efficiently.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Form the team and begin working</h2>
<p>If the future product of your startup is not too complex, hiring 1 of each needed specialists would be enough to form the backbone of the team. Should the project be challenging, you will need to spend some more time hiring the underlings to add more muscle. Keep in mind, A-grade team leads tend to hire A or B-grade executants, which is good for your project overall. Repeat the steps 2-3 until you feel confident the team you built is able to deal with the job at hand.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3076" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Great-in-house-team-of-developers-composition.jpg" alt="How to build a great in-house team of developers: composition" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
It seems we are all set and ready to go, isn’t it? However, there are certain obvious complications we mentioned when describing the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/hiring-dedicated-software-development-team-vs-building-house/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">differences between hiring a dedicated team of software developers and building such a team from scratch in-house</a>. The difficulties include (but are not limited to) the necessity to pay wages from the day one, the fact that the product cannot be completed if some specialist is not hired yet and the risk to slow or stop the overall progress should any of the team members decide to quit.</p>
<p>The solution to these complications was also described in the aforementioned article. Opt for hiring a dedicated software development team from an MSP to create a product for you. Once either the product starts generating revenues, or the next round of investments arrives, you can begin building your own team of software developers and gradually replacing the hired muscles with in-house talents.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on how to build a great in-house team of developers</h2>
<p>When your in-house personnel joins the work in progress it is easier for them to grasp the current stage of development by exploring the developer’s documentation and replace the contractor’s staff. Due to flexible outstaffing schemes many MSPs like <a href="https://itsvit.com/contacts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IT Svit can help</a> with the smooth transition of the product from their care to your team and provide backup and replacements should the need arise, not to mention training your team to use the existing systems and infrastructure with the utmost efficiency.</p>
<p>Thus said, we are firmly sure that with time every startup is able to build an in-house software development team to support and evolve their product. It’s developing the MVP that is slightly problematic if you don’t have a team at the ready. That’s where hiring a dedicated team of software developers will be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>We hope this article inspired some thinking and would be glad to know your opinion on the best ways to build a great in-house team of developers. Did you use the similar tactics or have a different know-how to build such teams?
