										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contracting IT developers from Ukraine is one of the most popular approaches to IT outsourcing. We provide skilled app developers in Ukraine for your business!</p>



<span id="more-6586"></span>



<p>IT outsourcing is a very popular approach to minimizing project expenses, shortening time-to-market for new products and features and optimizing business workflows. However, not all IT outsourcing companies provide equally good services and selecting the best web developer for your project is essential for ensuring its success. Over the years Ukraine has emerged as one of the most popular destinations for IT outsourcing. We list the factors that contribute to this and explain why contracting IT developers from Ukraine can be the best choice for your company.</p>



<p>IT outsourcing, in general, is the process of delegating certain tasks to a third-party company in order to avoid the need to build such an expertise in-house and optimize the allocation of resources. Cost reduction has always been the major reason for hiring dedicated teams of web developers, as the cost of living in various countries around the world differs a lot, so hiring skilled developers offshore is much more cost-efficient, than hiring them in-house in the US and EU. </p>



<p>However, as the IT outsourcing industry practices improved &amp; matured, the businesses discovered new benefits and value delivered by working with third-party IT services providers:</p>



<ul><li>Managed Services Providers <b>accumulate wide expertise</b> on various facets of software delivery and technology from their various projects, and they are usually using the best and latest tools and practices. Thus said, hiring a reliable MSP means gaining<b> instant access to a goldmine of skills</b>, solutions and the latest tech that can be leveraged in your projects.</li><li>IT outsourcing companies have to deal with <b>GDPR and other regulations</b> and adapt their processes to these requests. Therefore, when working with MSPs <b>you don’t have to worry about data security and compliance</b> requirements, as they are dealt with by the contractors.</li><li>IT outsourcing becomes a <b>long-term partnership</b>, rather than a one-time contract. An experienced MSP team possesses various skills and can help improve a wide plethora of processes outside the scope of the initial project, from infrastructure security audit and performance optimization to CI/CD implementation and automation of cloud monitoring, alerting and logging.</li></ul>



<p>Therefore, while working with a reliable IT outsourcing partner a business can gain significant competitive edge and optimize the expenses to ensure a healthy bottom line and succeed.</p>



<p>The most common use cases of outsourcing are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>software development,</li><li>web and mobile app development,</li><li>IT infrastructure operations,</li><li>blockchain development,&nbsp;</li><li>Big Data analytics implementation,&nbsp;</li><li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms training,&nbsp;</li><li>infrastructure security audit,&nbsp;</li><li>workflow optimization,&nbsp;</li><li>CI/CD implementation,&nbsp;</li><li>migration to the cloud from the legacy systems,&nbsp;</li><li>customer support, etc.</li></ul>



<p>Thus said, different IT service provider companies specialize in various aspects of this list. For example, India and the Philippines have long been the world leader in providing remote customer support, system administration and software development. However, as time went by, it became apparent that the overall level of their services is not sufficient to meet the project requirements of most companies. </p>



<p>This is why Big Data, AI and ML development largely moved to China, blockchain development is very popular amidst Japanese, Korean and South Asian customers, with nearly a hundred banks operating Ripple network for transactions there. At the same time, Eastern Europe and Ukraine became the new IT outsourcing hub and proved their quality throughout the years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ItSvit_good-developers_IT-outsourcing-market-of-Ukraine_2-100.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6590" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ItSvit_good-developers_IT-outsourcing-market-of-Ukraine_2-100.jpg 752w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ItSvit_good-developers_IT-outsourcing-market-of-Ukraine_2-100-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></figure>



<h2>IT outsourcing market of Ukraine — world-best web developers and DevOps engineers</h2>



<p>We have listed <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/20-reasons-order-outsourcing-services-ukraine/">20 reasons to order IT outsourcing services from Ukraine</a> in our blog some time ago. The most prominent of them are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>Ukraine is one of top 10 countries in Eastern Europe listed in Bloomberg Innovation Index 2018</li><li>Software developers of Ukraine are the best in building the cybersecurity systems, according to the results of HackerRank challenge</li><li>International technology consultancy company Clutch.co from Washington, D.C. lists more than 1600 companies that provide services from app developers in Ukraine. Many of these companies are rating leaders in their respective domains.</li><li>According to DOU.ua, a reputable IT-oriented portal in Ukraine, more than 80% of web developers in Ukraine speak English fluently or on Upper Intermediate level. This simplifies the communication greatly and removes cultural barriers, as compared to many other IT outsourcing locations worldwide.</li><li>More than 100 global leaders in gaming, appliances, telecom, finances, production, transportation and energy industry built R&amp;D centers for their app developers in Ukraine. Companies like Boeing, Samsung Electronics, IBM, Microsoft and others are contracting IT developers in Ukraine to develop the next generation of software for smart cities, Industry 4.0 factories and better living.&nbsp;</li><li>There are more than 180,000 DevOps engineers, Big Data analysts and app developers in Ukraine. This is the 4th largest pool of talents in Europe.</li><li>PWC places Ukraine as the №5 largest exporter of IT services and products worldwide</li><li>According to Gartner, Ukrainian developers are among the top 15 best worldwide, and we climb the ranks year by year.</li></ul>



<p>As a matter of fact, for the last 5 years most of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/10/16/ukraine-is-the-best-kept-secret-in-californias-startup-scene/#4ac6de7f7ebc">Silicon Valley startups outsource to Ukraine</a>, which gives them the competitive edge in the harsh and challenging US startup market.</p>



<p>This is possible, because many teams of located in Ukraine developers are composed of highly-experienced professionals that command a considerable knowledge of Java, Python, C++, Ruby-on-Rails, Angular, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Vue.js, Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, Jenkins, ELK stack, Prometheus + Grafana and many more DevOps tools and software development languages and platforms. </p>



<p>This allows developers of Ukraine to provide end-to-end solutions of any scope and complexity for businesses of any scale. Due to this, the US and EU businesses do not have to outsource to a variety of companies, do not have to manage them closely and do not have to worry about the resulting product quality. Your IT outsourcing company from Ukraine will be a reliable partner that will take care of the software delivery and operations, allowing you to concentrate on growing your business.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ItSvit_good-developers_Benefits-of-contracting_3-100.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6588" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ItSvit_good-developers_Benefits-of-contracting_3-100.jpg 753w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ItSvit_good-developers_Benefits-of-contracting_3-100-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure>



<h2>Benefits of contracting IT developers from Ukraine</h2>



<p>But why is choosing the Ukrainian developers better for your business and how do they work? We will explain this using the example of IT Svit workflows.</p>



<ol><li>When the customer contacts us with some request, we first find out the reason for doing this task. Sometimes, the business thinks they need to automate the server provisioning to cope with the workload spikes, for example, while they actually need configuring the auto-scaling group.&nbsp;</li><li>Most often, the infrastructure in place is the root of the issues. Infrastructure is built differently by every company, based on the skills, the tech and the budget available at the time. However, if your admins don’t have an extensive expertise with cloud infrastructure design, implementation and optimizations, certain mistakes are prone to be made and they can hinder your business growth at some time.</li><li>We audit the infrastructure in place by communicating with the key business stakeholders and IT talents in place to form a map of the servers, virtual machines, tools and workflows used. This helps us create an in-depth picture of the current infrastructure performance, room for growth and drawbacks.</li><li>Once we have a clear picture of the challenge the customer faces, we offer the most appropriate solution for it, based on our rich experience with providing managed DevOps services. Sometimes, this requires rebuilding the infrastructure from scratch.</li><li>Performing this audit and the following IT infrastructure optimization works as a pilot for both teams, helping us to form a cohesive workflow.</li><li>Should you need a software developed or updated, the stage above helps lay the ground for building CI/CD pipelines, which automate the infrastructure provisioning, configuration and management, greatly shortening the time-to-market for your products and features.</li><li>We perform the main work of the project, providing clear reports on the progress and applying your feedback if need be.</li><li>Once the project is complete, we provide the developer documentation to help your IT dept learn and use the new infrastructure and tools</li><li>We can teach your staff the basics of DevOps best practices to future-proof your business</li><li>We can also provide long-term technical support to make sure your business has all the technical issues covered from now on.</li></ol>



<p>This is an approximate workflow of a partnership with IT Svit. We are sure most of the other web developers in Ukraine work in similar ways, at least the most reliable of them. This process is adjusted according to the needs of the project, of course. We provide all the services from the aforementioned list — MVP development, blockchain development, splitting the monolith app to microservices, CI/CD implementation, cloud infrastructure configuration and management, database migrations, infrastructure migrations between cloud platforms, training ML and AI algorithms, long-term customer support, etc.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ItSvit_good-developers_conclusion_4-100.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6589" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ItSvit_good-developers_conclusion_4-100.jpg 753w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ItSvit_good-developers_conclusion_4-100-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure>



<h2>Go to Ukraine for developers and succeed!</h2>



<p>Thus said, Ukraine will be your best choice for outsourcing the software delivery and IT infrastructure management services. There are lots of skilled teams on the market and they can get you covered for a wide range of tasks. Should you want to work with the best, however — feel free to check customer reviews and ask for references. A reliable Managed Services Provider will be able to provide lots of references to satisfied customers and will have a plenty of positive customer reviews on various business rating platforms.</p>



<p>If you want us to provide you with the best DevOps engineers and software developers from Ukraine — contact us, we are always glad to help!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/where-to-get-good-developers-ukraine/">Where to get good developers?

					<description><![CDATA[<p>IT Svit has recently discovered an interesting tool that helps significantly decrease the complexity of onboarding into a running project. This framework is called Node-RED and allows representing the code in clear-to-read format, rearrange the code blocks and do lots of adjustments as easy as moving the blocks in a sketchbook.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/svit-uses-node-red-handling-js-development/">Why IT Svit uses Node-RED for handling the JS development</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are multiple illustrations of how inconvenient and effort-costly reading someone else’s code can be. IT Svit has encountered this problem more than once and Node-RED can help solve it for us — and for you.</p>
<p><span id="more-5020"></span></p>
<p>One of IT Svit projects, Asteria, involves integration with a bunch of banking services through APIs. The problem is that the code in production was developed by several different companies priorly, and is quite hard to maintain or improve in its current form.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5025 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reading_others_code.png" alt="IT Svit uses Node-RED: code mess" width="500" height="411" /></p>
<p>We tried to refactor the code and make it more logically structured, but quickly understood that this approach was used by all the predecessors, which resulted in the situation at hand. Their attempts to simplify the code structure resulted only in further complication.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5021 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/done_it_wrong_again.png" alt="IT Svit uses Node-RED:development done wrong" width="1048" height="797" /><br />
Thus said, we decided to opt for Node-RED, an open-source development framework intended for IoT app development but proven extremely useful for Node.JS, React.JS, Vue.JS, and other programming languages. Node-RED is like a sketchbook, where you can compose standard or custom nodes to create flows.<br />
There are several main types of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input nodes (red)</li>
<li>Output nodes (green)</li>
<li>Function nodes (orange)</li>
<li>Custom nodes (yellow and other palette colors)</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5024 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ITSvit_Node-RED_workflow.png" alt="IT Svit uses Node-RED:example workflow" width="568" height="74" /></p>
<p>Each of these nodes can contain either a standard node (with more than a hundred standard nodes available and new ones added regularly) or a custom code you can easily copy-paste or insert from GitHub. The platform also allows importing the JSON files and transforms their code into flow parts at once. All the API calls, invocations, and other operations are done automatically.</p>
<p>You enter the required credentials once — and can easily deploy the code along the CI/CD pipeline on AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud. Each node detects the variables in its code, and you can specify them with drop-downs or through convenient input fields.</p>
<p>Thus far, these are the <b>main Node-RED benefits</b> we were able to pinpoint for ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly lowers the project onboarding curve</li>
<li>Abundant FAQs and tutorials with working code examples</li>
<li>Helps visualize the development process and code execution logic for non-developers (Project Managers, Product Owners, stakeholders. etc.)</li>
<li>Simple import/ export to/from JSON files, which ensures cross-platform compatibility</li>
<li>Excludes “works on my machine” situations, as the code can be easily swapped between development requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of <b>Node-RED drawbacks</b> though:</p>
<ul>
<li>The syntaxis is slightly different from other JS tools. This is actually more of a benefit, as one can easily use the same logic for working with different programming languages.</li>
<li>There is no Ctrl+S function, but you can export the flow to a JSON file with ease.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions on Node-RED usage in IT Svit projects</h2>
<p>Thus far, applying this development visualization library helped us untangle and refactor the code on one project. While the time it took to master Node-RED amounts for nearly 10% of the whole project time, the ease of using the library has nearly halved the effort we spend on the code maintenance and ongoing development. We are looking forward to using this awesome technology in our future IoT-related projects, as well as in any projects where it will be applicable.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5023" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ITSvit_Node-RED_topic.jpg" alt="IT Svit uses Node-RED:future" width="1338" height="700" /></p>
<p>The best part is that Node-RED was released and open-sourced in 2013 and was named one of the <a href="https://nodered.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">founding projects of JS foundation in 2016</a>. This is definitely an established and reliable technology, so it’s safe to use and will not disappear in half a year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Need a web app? Use Node.js. Need a mobile app? Node.js. Front-end development? Node.js. Back-end development? Yeah, you guessed it… Node.js!</p>
<p><span id="more-3746"></span></p>
<p>Over the course of the 20th century, multiple programming languages were invented, rose to glory and fell to oblivion. Who uses Fortran, Pascal or Assembly nowadays? This is due to the fact each machine language was invented to fulfill a certain PURPOSE, and while it might have excelled in it, it surely had certain limitations. These limitations led to the need to invent a new language, and the developer’s community had to constantly re-train and master the new tools.</p>
<p>To say even more, certain languages do their job so well (like C++, Java or Python) that the developers had to specialize in them in order to be efficient and competitive. This specialization has obviously led to the need of employing rather large teams to be able to cover all the demands of the software delivery lifecycle. Back-end developers have different skills and use different tools to front-end developers, and even full-stack developers cannot work in 5-6 languages, they specialize in one pair. This is what the situation looked for decades, till 2009.</p>
<p>You know what happened in 2009? Ryan Dahl tried to upload an image to Flickr and while watching the upload progress bar he understood the browser did not know if the file was uploaded already and had to query the web server for that. Ryan decided there must be a better way. Thus, the concept of a <b>cross-platform Java runtime environment for server-side Javascript rendering was born</b>.</p>
<p>9 years later it’s hard to imagine browsing the web without Node.js. It caters to the needs of web developers, mobile app developers, desktop and even back-end developers! Here is how.</p>
<h2 id="frontend">Why Node.js is great for front-end web development</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3749" style="float: left; margin: 5px 25px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/front-end.jpg" alt="Node JS Frontend Development" width="120" height="120" />React, Angular and Vue power up Facebook, Google and Free-and-open-source-software community. These frameworks gave the front-end web developers the immense power to create highly-responsive and interactive user interfaces with server-side Javascript execution. We are now living in the age of the UI, and Node.js is what made it possible. Front-end web developers now have much more to offer to their customers — <b>web apps of any complexity</b>, even fully-fledged software applications <b>can be built using the power of React, Angular, Vue</b> — and Node.js</p>
<h2 id="mobile">Why Node.js is great for mobile app development</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3751" style="float: left; margin: 5px 25px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mobile-app.jpg" alt="Node JS Mobile Development" width="120" height="120" />Node.js is a <b>cross-platform</b> framework underpinning a huge ecosystem of tools, React Native being one of the most prominent examples. Where you previously had to hire a team of iOS developers and a separate team of Android developers — you can now use a single team of developers that write the common code in React Native and use platform-specific libraries to execute it runtime on iOS and Android. As <b>up to 90% of code can be shared and reused</b> between the platforms this way, the decrement in costs and development time is huge.</p>
<h2 id="backend">Why Node.js is great for back-end web development</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3752" style="float: left; margin: 5px 25px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/back-end.jpg" alt="Node JS Backend Development" width="120" height="120" />Node Package Manager or NPM allowed the Node ecosystem to flourish, as it enables building highly-specialized environments for literally any needs. However, one particular package might inspire a spark of understanding of our point — ExpressJS, the one simple and robust tool enabling building flexible and efficient mobile and web APIs with powerful capabilities. One such capability is <b>server-side rendering</b>.</p>
<p>We cannot emphasize this enough, as before the introduction of Node and Express, JS was merely a language to be used in-browser to execute on-page scripts. However, by harnessing the power of Express the <b>web server can assemble user interfaces of any complexity before the user’s browser even makes a request</b>. Did you notice how the web apps we use load nearly momentarily? Do you remember what it looked like before, when the pages were loading for several minutes sometimes? This is why <b>Node.js is a great tool for back-end web development</b>.</p>
<h2 id="final">Final thoughts on why Node.js is great for web development</h2>
<p>Please note, we do not say Node.js as a framework and JavaScript as a language are the perfect solutions for any case. Jack-of-all-trades will rarely be a master in any. Going with Java for Android app development and with Objective-C/Swift for developing iOS apps is the wisest choice. Python, R, and Ruby are better as tools for dealing with Big Data analytics and heavy-workload back-end applications. Nobody in their sane mind will state Node can even try to displace Java as the king of enterprise-grade web systems (or C#/ .NET for that sake in the Windows world).</p>
<p>What we try to point out is Node.js can be a common ground for web, mobile and back-end development, enabling the same team of software engineers to deliver the full cycle of software development services for lightweight, user-oriented apps with complex UI/UX. This makes a versatile tool, a worthy addition to any software development team’s toolkit.</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/node-js-past-present-future-web-development/">Why Node.js is the past, present and the future of web development</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launching your first website can be a daunting perspective for any entrepreneur. Thus said, this should be an informed decision, made after finding out all the possible circumstances.</p>
<p><span id="more-2963"></span></p>
<p>There are two main types of websites: informative and interactive. Informative websites contain mostly static information with limited interaction capabilities (blogs, forums, personal websites, business websites, etc.) Interactive websites contain dynamic content with rich interaction capabilities (news websites, video-streaming services, online shops, picture galleries, etc.)</p>
<p>There are lots of website builders available, which help create a website for free. These CMS’s and platforms include WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, etc. Nevertheless, their out-of-the-box functionality is pretty limited, additional plugins and add-ons might be bulky for customization and management. In addition, intense custom module development might be needed to make the website comply with your individual requirements, not to mention frequent news of loopholes and security flaws discovered within them, or the fact the number of (really good looking) templates is limited.</p>
<p>There are certain ways to save money using these website building platforms:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Use the templates to build a free website fast</b>. The platforms like WooCommerce, Magento, Shopify and others offer a variety of hosting options (from platform hosted websites to deploying your website to your custom hosting), and you can adjust the functionality the way you need.</li>
<li><b>Gather the following</b>. Reach out to the people, offer your services, ask if you can be of any help, answer their questions, provide real support. Not a single shiny ads campaign can earn you the respect and loyalty of your audience. Dedicated support can.</li>
<li><b>Market your products or services online</b>. Social media provide a great way to talk to your potential customers in person, at the time most convenient for them and provide all the details they might require. Avoid spending on printed ads, radio commercials and anything else from the brick-and-mortar shopping era. You sell the goods online and should advertise them online.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus said, these free websites can serve a couple of important goals for a startup:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;">They can help grow your customer audience and ensure the startup viability by generating some income</li>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;">They can help you make a list of requirements for your custom-tailored website</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you know what features and functionality you (and your customers) require from a website, it’s time to build your bespoke eCommerce website from scratch. This way you will be able to provide a unique design, functionality and user experience your customers would love.</p>
<p><a href="https://itsvit.com/contacts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2965 size-full" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Launching_a_Website_for_Startups_ITSvit_1.jpg" alt="True Costs Of Launching An Online Retail Website for Startups_1" width="1200" height="628" /></a></p>
<p>There are certain bad practices one should avoid at all costs while building a website. Keep them in mind and don’t fall for the fallacy of best intentions, family ties or friendly help:</p>
<p><b>Don’t mix family and business</b>. Unless your relative becomes your business partner or an employee, don’t ask them to build a website for you. Building a website implies multiple ongoing costs (hosting issues, maintenance, updating the modules, backups, and restoration, etc.). Unless you employ your relative full-time, asking for such a help would only ruin both your business and your family ties.</p>
<p><b>Don’t try to save on development by employing interns</b>. We all know software development, as well as website or web app development, might be expensive. In an attempt to save some money some startups opt for employing interns. Both sides seem to win from such agreement — the interns add some projects to their portfolio, while the startup saves a ton of money on salary. The downside of this approach is that if (or, to be correct, when) something goes wrong — you will have to find and hire the website original developer — or hire a company to deal with the issue, while your website is down.How to save money then? Outsourcing is the route the majority of businesses go, as the developers overseas might be as skilled at the domestic talents while costing significantly less. In addition, such managed services providers usually provide the full-cycle services for startups, including the product development, QA, maintenance, updates, scaling, and marketing promotion.<br />

There are but two concerns to have in mind: large development companies issue large checks and the cheapest product is never the high-quality one.<br />
<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2970 size-full" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Launching_a_Website_for_Startups_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="True Costs Of Launching An Online Retail Website for Startups_2" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
Here is the approximate spread of product quality depending on the development team location.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2967" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Launching_a_Website_for_Startups_ITSvit_3.jpg" alt="True Costs Of Launching An Online Retail Website for Startups_3" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p><b>Don’t stockpile the goods in advance</b>. The biggest advantage of eCommerce is that you are the medium between a customer and a manufacturer. You do not need to have a full warehouse of goods to sell them. Instead, you form a daily shopping cart and pay as it goes, while receiving payments from your customers. Have only as much as needed in stock to avoid paying the warehousing expenses.</p>
<p>Thus said, the best choice for launching an online retail shop for startups is outsourcing the job to a reputable managed services provider, which will deliver the high-quality project on time, have you covered with an in-depth SLA, provide 24/7 support and help your startup scale on request. This approach can help you <b>save up to 70% on development</b> without compromising on the quality! Affordable rates allow paying for time and resources spent on development while transparent project management ensures you are always in control of the process.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>One more of IT Svit customers has recently published a 5-out-of-5 star review on Clutch. We have built the backend environment to help The Network Cloud Company automate the deployment of their customized Linux environment and integrate their SymplyFI platform with a CRM and a dozen more modules. More details on this IT Svit project are available below.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/backend-infrastructure-design-development/">Backend Infrastructure Design & Development</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SymplyFI is a virtual telecom platform that helps manage the mobile and WAN networks for geographically-spread companies. IT Svit helped them automate their infrastructure design &amp; backend deployment.<br />
<span id="more-2822"></span><br />
<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2699" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/AWS_Infrastructure_ITSvit_Project_2-e1521477793723.png" alt="Resilient AWS Infrastructure_2" width="183" height="183" /></p>
<p>The customer has a product that has outgrown its current boundaries, so the need for the new infrastructure deployment process became obvious. The platform was built around 3 years ago and the configuration of its backend infrastructure was mostly manual, which resulted in <b>taking around 1,5 — 3 weeks</b> to build an infrastructure for a new client.</p>
<p>Thus said, the tasks at hand included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Automating the backend deployment process to shorten the time of provisioning the infrastructure for a new customer</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Developing a web application for the platform management for a customer</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Writing the application for management and configuration of SymplyFI provisioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project consisted of 4 major parts:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Developing a tool for automation of backend infrastructure services provisioning</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Delivering the design and architecture for integration of backend services with the customer’s CRM platform</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Designing and developing a gateway for connecting multiple modules from various vendors using RabbitMQ</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Developing a holistic application for combining and configuring all the modules to automatically provision, configure and manage the platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2>DevOps solution design and development</h2>
<p>We decided to use Python, Django, Ansible, CentOS 7 and Proxmox for the job. In-depth understanding of the infrastructure operations allowed our team to produce working, efficient models of the required software architecture. With time, all technical project management tasks were delegated to our company, which assumed the role of the technical PM for the development of all the variety of the platform modules.</p>
<div class="clutch-widget" data-url="https://clutch.co" data-widget-type="4" data-expandifr="true" data-height="auto" data-snippets="true" data-clutchcompany-id="79983">The development process itself is controlled via daily communications, where the team outlines the tasks at hand and proposes the ways to overcome the challenges if any appear. At the end of the working day, the reports highlighting the progress being made, so the customer always keeps a hand on the pulse.</div>
<p>Aside from that, there are direct status calls each Tuesday and Thursday, where IT Svit technical PM coordinates the work of multiple development teams, allowing the customer to free the internal resources and <b>save around 30% of the estimated budget</b>. To say even more, IT Svit team is always ahead of deadlines.</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 10px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;"><p><em>“They’ve come in under every deadline we&#8217;ve had. They&#8217;re typically done before we&#8217;re ready for them to be done. That&#8217;s been consistent throughout all the work they&#8217;ve done for us.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>IT Svit team delivers consistent top-quality results within time and proposes ready solutions instead of asking for directions. The customer is greatly pleased with the progress so far and plans to delegate even more tasks, including the web design and development for the new version of the platform, to IT Svit.</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 10px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;"><p><em>“They work fewer hours than other vendors on similar engagements but get twice as much done, if not more. They might be more expensive, but it’s worth it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The automation of the backend infrastructure configuration resulted in <b>cutting the time</b> needed to provision the platform for a new user <b>from 1,5 weeks to 1 hour</b>. Thus said, The Network Cloud Company is able to serve hundreds of customers monthly, which opens incredible new perspectives for them in terms of conquering the market.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2823" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Backend_Infrastructure_Design_ITSvit_Project.png" alt="Backend Infrastructure Design &amp; Development" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>Most importantly, outsourcing to IT Svit allowed the customer to drastically reduce time to market for the new version of their product.</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 10px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;"><p><em>“They’ll save you not just money but time. They’ll improve the quality of your work because they’re invested in it and perform extremely well.”</em></p></blockquote>
