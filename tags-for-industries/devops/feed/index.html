										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are the US-based energy company in need of cloud computing services — you’ve come to the right place! IT Svit is an IT outsourcing provider that fields experienced dedicated teams that can manage the cloud infrastructure for the energy company.</p>
<p><span id="more-7905"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern energy industry is unlike anything that was before. Thousands of private energy producers trade power via blockchain ledgers and operate edge computing nodes on their home power plants. If you want to succeed in this highly-competitive market — IT Svit can help enable cloud services for your energy company. From application development to cloud infrastructure management — we’ve got your cloud service requirements covered!  </span></p>
<h3>We configure cloud storage for your energy company</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy business benefits from the cloud services as much as any other. When your systems are safe and sound in the cloud, are able to handle any numbers of connections and store your data securely using the cloud services — you can do much more while spending much less. IT Svit is proficient in delivering cloud storage for the energy industry and configuring all kinds of cloud services your business might need.</span></p>
<h3>Reduction of expenses and better operational flexibility for your energy business</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the energy companies that come to IT Svit think they need the cloud to reduce their operational expenses and increase their flexibility. As it often turns out, we can provide much more value, from automating various aspects of infrastructure operations to rebuilding the process of interaction with your external system components through using the latest RESTful APIs and much, much more.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7907" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Energy-company-cloud-02-min.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Energy-company-cloud-02-min.jpg 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Energy-company-cloud-02-min-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2>We excel at managing the cloud infrastructure for the energy company!</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business should evolve and adopt the latest technology to remain competitive, and the energy industry is no exception. Oil and gas companies that invested heavily in their mainframe systems, now seek the ways to automate their operations and make them more error-proof and not reliant on manual control. Cloud computing provides this possibility, as all the software and drivers used to operate the machinery can be run as virtualized applications in Docker containers, to ensure their fault-tolerance, scalability and resilience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, lowering the expenses is not as crucial for the energy companies as increasing the speed and reliability of operations. Using the cloud infrastructure for the cloud company means the ability to transfer huge quantities of data between on-prem installation and devices, process it in the cloud and ensure their security and compliance — as the energy industry is one of the most heavily regulated domains of business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cloud backup for the energy industry data means SOX compliance is much easier to manage, as the data can be quickly backed up and restored using the cloud storage like Amazon S3 or Google Storage. System monitoring, billing, accounting. sending automated reports to regulatory bodies through RESTful APIs — the benefits of using cloud services for the energy industry are literally endless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main issue here is not to rush the cloud implementation, as the cloud services are no panacea for the energy industry. In order to be efficient, these systems must be well-thought-out, built and configured correctly, so they solve the energy business challenges, instead of introducing the new ones. This is why IT Svit recommends performing the transition to cloud computing for the energy company in three major stages.</span><b></b></p>
<h3>Build the roadmap of the needed improvements using internal experts</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed Services Providers like IT Svit can configure the cloud computing services and build the CI/CD pipelines for developing new modules for your applications — but only your in-house engineers know how your systems work, what the bottlenecks are and how to remove them with the utmost efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus said, understanding what is wrong with the current workflows and how this can be mended can be very beneficial before adopting cloud computing for the energy company. Build the detailed scheme of your systems, tools and workflows, highlight the performance bottlenecks and describe what you want — then let the IT services provider do what needs to be done in order to achieve these results. This way you will be able to formulate the business objectives you want to achieve, and we will be able to propose the best ways to do it.</span></p>
<h3>Keep a close eye on interoperability and integrations</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every energy industry company has to interact with various third-party businesses and regulatory bodies. Over the time of your being in the business, you surely had instated some processes and tools for such interactions, and these can be affected when moving to the cloud. Understanding the way these interactions work and how they can be replaced and improved by using cloud services for the energy company is crucial for ensuring your cloud transition is successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to deal with this transition is to have a fully-integrated cloud database solution able to interact with all your external contractors via RESTful APIs. However, the system and infrastructure of your partners can not be ready for such a transaction, and you cannot operate in a vacuum. Thus said, it is best to consult with your long-term partners and discuss the best ways to proceed with your digital transformation, so they can keep up and the normal flow of business interactions is not disrupted.</span></p>
<h3>Treat the cloud as a tool, not the goal</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving to the cloud infrastructure for the energy company is not the goal of the project, it is merely the means to an end. The ultimate goal of such a transition is to ensure better operational flexibility and future-proof your business, so you are able to innovate better and grow exponentially. This can be achieved by introducing a new business culture and better understanding the ways to use cloud services for the energy industry businesses, to plan proactively and react to new circumstances rapidly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Svit is an IT outsourcing provider with 15 years of expertise in providing remote system administration services, a decade of hands-on experience in software delivery and 5 years in providing DevOps services and cloud infrastructure management. We know how to use cloud services to reach specific goals of any business — but it is up to you to provide the list of specific goals you need to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus said, IT Svit can help your energy company with the full range of cloud services:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessment of your existing infrastructure and processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forming a list of suggestions to overcome the existing bottlenecks based on input from your stakeholders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing these solutions to streamline your processes and increase their efficiency</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving your data and workflows to the cloud seamlessly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enabling CI/CD processes for software delivery processes and the management of cloud infrastructure for the cloud company</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building logging, monitoring, and smart alerting solutions for your business</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an energy business in need of infrastructure optimization, rebuilding your application to be cloud-native or running your cloud infrastructure — IT Svit is the right partner.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business providing streaming cloud services for the customers in the US and globally must use the most reliable cloud storage for video streaming and uninterrupted availability. IT Svit provides skilled DevOps dedicated teams that configure and manage video streaming cloud services.</span><span id="more-7899"></span></p>
<p>Using cloud computing for video streaming enables thousands of simultaneous connections worldwide to your platform and multiple interactions like chatting, SuperChatting, free and paid subscriptions, donating through various payment gateways. All of these features depend on the seamless interaction of several cloud components, which is crucial for providing a positive end-user experience. IT Svit helps configure the cloud infrastructure required for this.</p>
<h2>Enabling cloud backup for video streaming services</h2>
<p>Lots of data must be processed in real-time when operating video streaming cloud computing services. However, connection breaks still happen and not all video data gets rendered and saved in time. This is why enabling various kinds of cloud backup for video streaming is crucial. Caching and periodic automated database backups ensure the integrity and continuity of services provided. Our <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps engineers</a> can configure cost-efficient and reliable cloud backup procedures for streaming.</p>
<h2>CI/CD cloud services for video streaming</h2>
<p>No product is perfect from the get-go, and this applies to cloud video streaming services as well. They must be further developed and improved after release while ensuring the video streaming platform updates and new features don’t interfere with the uninterrupted availability of services in operation. IT Svit ensures this by enabling CI/CD workflows for your ongoing software development and cloud infrastructure management. We can ensure your platform works without lags and is updated without downtime!</p>
<h2>Full range of video streaming cloud services for your business!</h2>
<p>Every business aiming to build a successful video streaming platform needs to ensure it provides a range of useful features. Video streaming and storing the videos left aside, there should be the ability to chat with the streamer and store the records of these chats, make donations in any currency and through a variety of payment gateways, provide some account analytics, etc. In some cases, there might be a need for private chat rooms, as well as using virtual reality equipment or some other latest technological innovation.</p>
<p>Thus said, while all of these functions are nice to have, it is hard to implement them all at once. This means that your cloud video streaming service must be lean and frugal at the start. Most of the video streaming businesses begin by building the most basic functions into their platform and releasing the MVP to start rolling the money in. Once the business passes the breakeven point and starts to grow — it’s time to add more features to further secure your position and reach new horizons.</p>
<p>Thus said, there are 3 distinctive phases of software delivery for every video streaming platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>initial cloud infrastructure configuration and MVP development</li>
<li>product release and ongoing development</li>
<li>scaling to enterprise and continuous monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these phases has its unique challenges and requires specific tools and skills to solve them.</p>
<p>The first phase of software development starts with the design of the future platform. Based on the project requirements, it is best to plan the structure to be modular and make the modules interact via RESTful APIs, so any number of additional modules can be easily added to the system and integrated with the existing functionality seamlessly.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7901" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Cloud-for-video-streaming_2-min.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Cloud-for-video-streaming_2-min.jpg 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Cloud-for-video-streaming_2-min-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>It is also needed to correctly configure the future infrastructure supporting <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/cloud-computing/">cloud computing</a> for video streaming. The environments should be virtualized to enable rapid deployment and decommissioning upon request. All the instances should be exactly the same to minimize the risk of misconfiguration and critical bugs hampering the production. The software delivery process must be reliable and new features must be delivered according to the schedule. The infrastructure operations must be transparent and take as little time as possible.</p>
<p>Using cloud computing for video streaming solves all of these challenges.</p>
<ol>
<li>All cloud computing resources are virtualized, so any type of cloud environment you need can be almost instantly provisioned and configured. It can be shut down as easily when it is no longer needed.</li>
<li>Using Docker containers running in Kubernetes clusters ensures all the copies of your app running in production are the same, so-called Infrastructure as Code approach. Your application runs atop the same infrastructure all the way from the Individual Development Environment to testing, staging and production environments. This means there is no configuration drift between various servers, effectively nullifying the risk of bugs making their way to production or security breaches resulting from overdue security patches. Besides, when each platform component runs as a separate microservice inside a Docker container and interacts with the other modules via RESTful APIs, the resulting system is modular and easy to upgrade.</li>
<li>Cloud services enable Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Integration (CI) of new code into your project, reducing time-to-market significantly and enabling your developers to produce new features on time and according to the schedule. This is possible due to the ability to configure multiple cloud computing services and tools to automatically use the output of one operation as an input of another operation. This helps automate various routine monitoring, logging, cloud backup and restoration operations, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted operations of your video streaming services.</li>
<li>The same CI/CD principles work in monitoring and logging so that your systems are always under control and smart alerts are in place. This way, instead of dealing with the consequences of infrastructure failure, your team will be able to respond at the early stages and mitigate the danger early. For example, the rapid increase of active connections can cause lags and stream crash situations if the system cannot handle such workloads. Launching additional app instances as Docker containers on the Kubernetes cluster can happen automatically as a response to workload growth. Most importantly, the system monitors the workload automatically, and once the peak load is over, excessive instances will be shut down automatically, ensuring cost-efficiency, manageability and transparency of your cloud computing operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>IT Svit helps make this situation a reality by providing expert cloud services for video streaming. As a Managed Services Provider, we can help at any stage, from providing cloud architects and developers to build the video streaming application for your business, all the way to helping to optimize the infrastructure and workflows in place. We manage cloud computing for streaming services for more than 5 years and have amassed lots of ready solutions for most typical challenges, reducing the time needed to accomplish your project.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we are an IT outsourcing company, meaning you gain instant access to dedicated teams of qualified specialists with polished workflows, which costs less than gathering such a team in-house — and brings fruit earlier! If this sounds like something your startup needs — IT Svit would be glad to help configure and run cloud services for streaming for you!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/cloud-services-for-video-streaming-from-it-svit/">Cloud Services For Video Streaming From IT Svit</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Financial cloud services are an important part of any business, be it US-based or global. IT Svit provides experienced DevOps dedicated teams that enable various approaches to use cloud computing in financial services.<span id="more-7886"></span></p>
<p>Every business that interacts with its customers online has to have some sort of financial services in play. Whether your company provides financial services or just accepts some payments for your products and services — this is best done in the cloud. IT Svit helps enable cloud computing in financial services and reach any business objectives your company might have.</p>
<h2>Running your cloud-based financial services</h2>
<p>If your company provides financial services, cloud computing is the best choice to host them. Cloud platforms like AWS or Google provide security, scalability and reliability of operations. IT Svit helps configure cloud computing for financial services to maximize its cost-efficiency, transparency and manageability.</p>
<h2>Building your financial cloud solutions</h2>
<p>If your business has to process lots of financial transactions, it is best to do this in the cloud. This helps keep customer data and billing history in encrypted form in secure databases to prevent any danger of misappropriation or hacking. IT Svit can enable various security measures to keep your customer financial data on the safe side.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7888" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Financial-cloud_Building-solutions_2.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Financial-cloud_Building-solutions_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Financial-cloud_Building-solutions_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2>Using cloud in financial services</h2>
<p>Every business has to interact with its customers somehow. This interaction must involve a financial component, as every business wants to make a profit. Regardless of your business model, whether financial services are the core of your business or just the means to pay for your products or services — this is sensitive information that can be always available and stored securely. Thus said, using the cloud in financial services is an essential component of success for any business.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of the cloud is its scalability. You rent some cloud resources that should be sufficient for your needs, but if they are not enough and you need more — the cloud allows you to get more in seconds while configuring another dedicated server can take up to several hours. As all the cloud resources allocated in the geographical vicinity of your cloud vendor’s availability zone are combined in a common pool using virtualization, you can configure the system to add more resources and scale horizontally and vertically with ease, should the need arise. What is even more important, once the workload spike is over, the excessive resources can easily be shut down and returned to the vendor’s pool, so you don’t overpay for idle servers.</p>
<p>This approach ensures the cost-efficiency of operations and is reflected by the Pay-As-You-Go billing model used in the cloud. You are billed per second (or millisecond for some web services like serverless computing), which helps minimize the bills for your financial services in the cloud.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, security is crucial, and cloud architecture helps ensure security. AWS CloudTrail, Google Security, Kubernetes Pod Security Policies, secure architecture of Docker containers, database encryption and process isolation — all of these features and web services can safeguard the sensitive data of your customers.</p>
<p>Using the cloud to run your financial services ensures the systems are highly secure, perform well under heavy workloads, can scale up and down easily to meet your business demands  — but turning this into reality requires some in-depth understanding of cloud computing, as well as the precise configuration of various systems and web services.</p>
<p>This is where IT Svit steps in. We provide 5+ years of expertise with configuring the cloud computing features to run financial services, so our customers can be sure their projects are always online and run cost-efficiently. From building and running e-Commerce sites to delivering payment processors and enabling the swift performance of distributed apps based on the blockchain technology — IT Svit can handle any implementation of cloud computing for financial services.</p>
<h3>Building solutions for cloud financial services</h3>
<p>All the aforementioned benefits of using cloud computing to run financial services apply only on one condition — if your cloud infrastructure is configured correctly. You need to have an in-depth knowledge of the ways various web services work and interact, what cloud-native AWS or Google Cloud Platform features are essential for running your project and what could be replaced with open-source alternatives with relative ease.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways your cost-efficiency can fail, cloud security can be breached and sensitive data of your customers can be exposed — from subpar system structure planning to incorrect settings of various system components and modules. For example, almost all cloud-based financial services nowadays run atop Kubernetes clusters, but nearly 90% of those are run with Pod Security Policies disabled (as these are disabled by default). Thus said, IT Svit has had a fair share of uncovering potential security breaches, meaning sensitive data and financial transaction details of your business can be at risk.</p>
<p>IT Svit has developed a detailed procedure for building secure, cost-efficient and highly-performant solutions for financial services in the cloud for our customers. We can help redesign the existing systems to correct the initial architectural flaws in your cloud infrastructure, implement new solutions to ensure cost-efficiency and build these solutions to be easily manageable and scalable — but to make certain these don’t scale out of hand.</p>
<p>The last, but not the least important application of cloud computing for financial services is the continuous development of your product to remain competitive on the market. This means implementing CI/CD pipelines — automated processes of interaction between various tools that enable the developers to build, test, perform canary deployments and push their code into production much easier than with a standard Git-flow.</p>
<p>This ensures predictability of releases, transparency of deployments, greatly reduces the number and severity of bugs discovered in production, enormously reduces the feedback loop and time-to-market for new features. The same principles can be applied to cloud infrastructure management, enabling smart monitoring logging and alerting, as well as automated response scenarios for the most common incident types, greatly reducing the strain of managing your daily IT operations in the cloud.</p>
<h3>Why hire IT Svit to manage your cloud-based financial services?</h3>
<p>The key benefit of partnering with a Managed Services Provider like IT Svit is that we are able to provide the full range of software development and cloud infrastructure management services for any aspect of financial services your business is involved with. We can ensure the security of your financial transactions, the resilience of your financial cloud services, the speed and reliability of your software development, updates and monitoring.</p>

<h2>Benefits of cloud computing for the telecom industry</h2>
<p>With worldwide adoption of 5G networks around the corner, many businesses in the telecom industry face the need to update their hardware, software and processes, before these become legacy and impact your competitiveness. There are huge benefits to be had by adopting the telecom industry cloud services early. First, you can save on upgrading your hardware once and for all. Second, you can reconfigure the infrastructure with ease should the need arise. As a dollar saved is a dollar earned, every forward-thinking company can earn millions by using cloud computing for telecom.</p>
<p>This is possible due to the fact that the upcoming 5th generation of networks is not using the same architecture as all the previous ones. With 3G and 4G, you had to buy the hardware with rigid specifications that could be used for intended purposes only. If you needed to add 2 more cables, you needed to add a whole box with 10 slots, etc. If some connection gets fried, you need to buy a new piece of hardware quite often. If a new gadget is not compatible with your devices — you need to update the drivers, which can result in more compatibility issues, etc.</p>
<p>Thus said, 5G is built on the principles of virtualization to avoid the rigid specifications of software and limitations of the hardware. The three basic principles of 5G are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>VNF — Virtual Network Functions — all software (drivers) for the main network components are virtualized. This means that all modules are run as Docker containerized applications atop a virtualized Terraform infrastructure.</li>
<li>NFV — Network Functions Virtualization — the whole network structure runs as a Kubernetes cluster of Docker containers in the cloud, without the need to buy any piece of hardware. Like, ever.</li>
<li>SDN — Software-Defined Networking — using code to define the network settings and parameters. Ansible and Jenkins are the tools allowing to build and configure 5G networks within minutes, not within hours and days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, the 5th generation of networks can be installed for literally no cost, configured in minutes and adjusted on the move should the need arise. This literally saves millions of dollars in terms of CAPEX investments, worktime and reduction of misconfiguration risks. There are many other cloud benefits for telecom.</p>
<h3>Advantages of the cloud services for telecom</h3>
<p>Cloud storage for the telecom industry ensures all the data is securely stored in the cloud in an encrypted form, is easily available from any device and in any geographical location. This is the high-availability feature, made available by replicating the data across distributed clusters of high-velocity databases. This way, all the data is gathered, processed, stored and streamed in real-time in multiple locations across the globe and even a complete power shutdown in one location will not cripple your operations.</p>
<p>Cloud backup for the telecom industry is the natural consequence of cloud data storage. The data is backed up by replicating it across several database instances in a hybrid cloud, so even if on-prem servers get damaged in any disaster, the data is safe and sound in the cloud. The procedure of cloud backup for telecom can be done in batches or in real-time while you are actually streaming, so not a bit of data is lost, ever.</p>
<p>Cloud scalability ensures your systems can handle any number of visitors and any workload. If the monitoring modules detect workload spikes, they spin up more VNFs in seconds, so your system does not lag or crash. Later on, when the spike is over, the excessive VNFs are shut down automatically to conserve your resources.</p>
<p>Cloud services for telecom are cost-efficient, as they are provided under the Pay-As-You-Go billing model. This means that instead of buying or renting hardware servers in dedicated data centers and paying for them 24/7 regardless of the actual resource consumption ratio, cloud users order virtualized instances with some quotas of resources that can be additionally flexibly adjusted.</p>
<p>For example, if you need more CPU power to process large volumes of information or more RAM to do it faster or more disk space to store it — your cloud instance can be scaled up and down both horizontally and vertically. Most importantly, these resources are available at any time and can be provisioned within seconds upon request — and shut down as quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Does it sound great for you? The only question remains — how to gain access to all these tangible benefits? the answer is — by using <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps services</a>!</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7879" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_cloud-computing-for-telecom_Importance-of-DevOps_3.png" alt="" width="1141" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_cloud-computing-for-telecom_Importance-of-DevOps_3.png 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_cloud-computing-for-telecom_Importance-of-DevOps_3-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></p>
<h3>Importance of DevOps cloud services for the telecom industry</h3>
<p>Cloud hosting operates quite differently, as compared to working with dedicated servers or virtual machines that are the mainframe of modern 3G/4G telecom networks. Instead of physical bare-metal servers with limited resource capacities, you operate virtualized instances that draw the needed resources from a common pool. When these resources are not needed, they are returned to the pool to be used — and paid for — by other customers.</p>
<p>This is a great and welcome improvement over the existing situation when a telecom company must be constantly investing in buying new hardware, as the old one rapidly becomes legacy and obsolete. Instead, from 5G going onward, no CAPEX will be required to update your systems. The only OPEX needed is the DevOps expertise to operate the cloud, as the existing telecom industry IT professionals rarely have the skills required to enable VNF, NFV and SDN. They have invaluable experience with specific telecom solutions architecture and best practices of its organization, though.</p>
<p>This is why the best way to approach the oncoming transition to 5G networks is by combining the expertise of your telecom industry computing services with a profound DevOps knowledge from a Managed Services Provider like IT Svit. We have ample experience with software delivery and cloud infrastructure management, and we will be able to apply it to replicating your existing IT infrastructure in the cloud, while also optimizing it to future-proof your operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various food delivery companies in the US and worldwide move their operations to the cloud to gain more operational flexibility. IT Svit helps achieve this result and provides dedicated teams that configure the cloud for food delivery businesses.</span><span id="more-7846"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food delivery is a highly competitive business that must be flexible to ensure quick stock turnover and cost-efficient operations. Running IT operations systems in the cloud is obviously the best choice for a food delivery service. IT Svit helps configure cloud services for food delivery applications to ensure maximum resilience, scalability and high-availability of your operations.</span></p>
<h2>Infrastructure<b> management and cloud backup for food delivery companies</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personnel of food delivery companies must be able to access your systems from the office, from their smartphones or tablets in the cars or even get notifications to their smartwatches. This means your app must run in the cloud to ensure ease and speed of access, high velocity of information updates and secure cloud backup for operational data. IT Svit helps configure cloud services for food delivery apps for top-notch performance.</span></p>
<h2>Optimizing<b> cloud computing for food delivery app development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To remain competitive and ensure uninterrupted value delivery for both your team and your customers, you should ensure the feedback loops are as short as possible. This means the process of implementing feedback and adding new features must take the least time. This is possible if your team benefits from CI/CD pipelines powered by cloud computing features. IT Svit can configure these pipelines to minimize the time-to-market for your product updates.</span></p>
<h2><b>We</b> provide<b> managed cloud services for food delivery companies</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fast-paced business world of the 21st century, the only way for a business to survive and succeed is to remain competitive and utilize every possible advantage. <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/cloud-computing/">Cloud computing</a> is one of such advantages, quickly becoming a necessity for goal-oriented businesses. By running applications and systems in the cloud, every company ensures resilience and security, manageability and cost-efficiency of operations. This is especially so for food delivery services, as successfully running such a business requires using a complex software ecosystem spanning both office workspaces and mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your delivery trucks must get live updates on the traffic situation and the resupply schedule during the day. Your office personnel must keep track of the food supplies in the warehouses and direct the trucks there in such a way as to ensure optimal loading speed and traveling routes. Your teams must remain in touch all the time in case the situation changes rapidly, etc. It is obvious that the reliability and speed of software operations and communication systems are essential for the success of such a business.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7849" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_advantages_2.png" alt="" width="1141" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_advantages_2.png 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_advantages_2-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing provides all the advantages listed above — if one has the expertise required to leverage them.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Scalability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cloud resources are rented in virtual instances with configurable quotas. These quotas can be increased on-demand, ensuring your business always has exactly as many resources as it needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cloud platforms provide a wide variety of security features, both structural — like private subnets and bastion hosts or Docker containers, and procedural, like Google Stackdriver or Amazon CloudWatch web services. Storing data in the cloud is the most secure way of keeping your sensitive information (like billing data and personal details of your customers) safe.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>High-availability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike dedicated servers with limited throughput, cloud virtual machines provide literally unlimited connectivity. Most importantly, your applications can run in the cloud availability zones closets to your area of operations to ensure minimal latency and stable uplink for all the devices involved.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cost-efficiency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cloud services are rented under the Pay-As-You-Go billing model, meaning you pay only for the resources consumed. Thus said, you can configure your cloud instances to provide the absolute minimum of resources required to run your systems and develop your applications. Then you can easily scale the system up and down as needed, to ensure maximum cost-efficiency of your cloud investments — unlike dedicated bare-metal servers, which you buy or rent and pay for their operations 24/7, regardless of if you actually use them to full capacity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Predictability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Due to <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps automation</a> of cloud infrastructure management, you can minimize the time needed to provision and configure new virtual environments or perform some routine operations, like cloud backup for food delivery apps. Therefore, the software development process becomes much more reliable and predictable, allowing you to implement customer feedback and update your systems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7848" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_principles_3.png" alt="" width="1141" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_principles_3.png 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_principles_3-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this is possible due to three basic DevOps principles that enable the automation of software delivery and infrastructure management operations: IaC, CI and CD.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IaC means </span><b>Infrastructure as Code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Settings and parameters of all infrastructure environments are codified in a form of textual configuration files, so-called manifests. These manifests are written in simple descriptive language, stored at some Version Control System and can be versioned like any other code. Thus said, a DevOps engineer can prepare these manifests for all repetitive scenarios and easily adjust them to meet the changing requirements. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This simplifies software development and infrastructure management immensely, as all it takes a developer to load the required testing environment and perform automated unit and integrity testing for a new batch of code is just loading the required manifest in a single click. No need to wait for the Ops engineer to provision and configure the required server — and no need for you to pay for this server while it is on standby.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, IaC solves the “works on my machine” conundrum, as all the environments are built automatically, using the same Docker images and run in the same Docker containers, so there are no discrepancies between the IDE, testing, staging and production environments and the code works exactly the same on every stage of delivery. This removes the risk of major bugs making it to production and causing post-release system crashes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CI means</span><b> Continuous Integration</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This principle declares that instead of splitting the project into several long branches and merging them before the release (causing several bugs, some of which can make it to production), your application is developed in small chunks, where new batches of code are continuously integrated into the main project trunk. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is enabled by IaC, as instead of running a hard-to-reconfigure test server farm, your development team provisions testing environments for themselves in a matter of seconds, uses them to perform automated unit and integrity code tests and pushes the code to the staging server for high-level testing by QA engineers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This principle works for feedback loops as well, as automating the software delivery and testing through IaC and CI enables you to implement new features based on customer feedback and stakeholder input quite rapidly, in weeks instead of months.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CD means </span><b>Continuous Delivery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is the second part of a CI/CD pipeline, an ability to configure the DevOps toolkit and a bunch of cloud-specific web services in such a way, that the outcome of every operation becomes the input of the next operation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the commit of a new batch of code to the repository launches the appropriate manifest, which creates the required testing environment and the code is run against the automated tests. If the tests succeed, the code is automatically pushed to the staging server, where the latest application build is prepared for testing. If the tests fail, the alert is raised to the developer and the code is given back for bugfixes, reverting the commit. The testing environments are then decommissioned to save resources, till the next time, as it takes only a couple of seconds.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same approach works for infrastructure management, where multiple operations like cloud backup for food delivery applications and data can be done completely automatically.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in order to use these benefits to the full extent, your business must have access to skilled DevOps engineers, who can configure cloud computing for food delivery businesses. IT Svit can help you with this task, as we can provide assistance on every stage of software development and with every aspect of infrastructure management.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a secret that demand for food delivery grew </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immensely with the quarantine going on. Online food delivery platforms face huge loads of traffic these days, the majority of web and mobile applications hardly ready to handle the demand. DevOps can help with smooth experience for users, prevent downtime and much more.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7799"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 outbreak that grew into a pandemic and forced nearly all of the world to go on quarantine. . This means citizens are unable to visit a restaurant — but many restaurants have already got their delivery services operating before the quarantine. The challenge now is to handle the increased traffic and ensure system resilience under heavy workloads. Contracting DevOps for delivery services can help restaurants handle the changing operational landscape and turn this crisis into opportunity by providing a viable alternative to dining out for their customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does an online delivery service for a restaurant need? </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be able to receive orders from the website, from a mobile app, or even through a chatbot</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be able to handle various payment gateways</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must support the “forgotten cart” feature, reminding the customers of their unfinished orders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must store the history of previous orders for the purpose of analytics and enabling loyalty programs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these features can be enabled by the app itself, either through add-ons and plugins or through a custom functionality — given time. And time is a luxury we cannot afford to waste right now, as the world is awakening from slumber and realizing it can work, learn, relax and order food online while being efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, All Set Now, a Ukrainian startup that has currently connected more than 2,500+ restaurants in 12 cities across the USA. Participating in All Set Now partner network has enabled these establishments to grow their delivery revenue and increase their table turnover by 200%, while their customers live a healthier and happier life, being able to order any meals quicker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just the beginning of literally endless possibilities your business can unlock if you decide to utilize this situation to the max. Using AR/VR to provide a preview of a custom meal for your clients? With ease! Leveraging voice assistants to form orders? Not a problem. Modern technology allows being as innovative as you wish within the timeframes and budget limits you have. And this is where the hard part begins — as quarantine means the absence of visitors, thus you have very limited time and budget before you are forced to go bankrupt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where DevOps can be a lifesaver, allowing your restaurant business to quickly develop and launch a bespoke delivery service solution to cater to the needs of your frequenters and enable them to continue eating the meals they love but cannot cook at home.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7801" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ItSvit_DevOps-for-delivery_What-is-DevOps-anyways_2.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ItSvit_DevOps-for-delivery_What-is-DevOps-anyways_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ItSvit_DevOps-for-delivery_What-is-DevOps-anyways_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2><b>What is DevOps anyways? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps is a methodology of software development and cloud infrastructure management enabling the businesses to deliver apps and manage them in production in a quick and cost-efficient way. This is achieved through automation of repetitive tasks and building CI/CD pipelines, where the IT systems supporting your operations can run with little effort and supervision from your team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is even more important for restaurants, who normally don’t have a software development team in-house, DevOps services providers can also field dedicated teams of software engineers. This way you get instant access to teams of qualified specialists able to build an application for you and ensure it is done quickly and cost-efficiently. How is it done?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building and running any software in a production environment involves multiple repetitive operations, testing environment provisioning and new app version building being the most frequent and time-consuming. DevOps engineers automate this process through using toolchains like Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm and Docker to enable IaC — </span><b>Infrastructure as Code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With it, all the parameters and variables of every computing environment needed for developing your application are written down in simple descriptive language in a form of text files — so-called “manifests”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These manifests are stored on GitHub and can be accessed and versioned by any developer like any other code, so deploying a new version of any required environment requires only loading the corresponding manifest. This shortens the software delivery cycle by as much as 90% and allows building new products over the span of weeks and months, not years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step of the DevOps journey is using </span><b>CI/CD pipelines</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery processes. These are automated scenarios that use the output of a previous operation as an input for the next operation. Once configured, CI/CD pipelines ensure new code is can be automatically tested, built, pushed to the staging server, tested again and pushed to production with a single code commit, should the tests succeed. This ensures the speed and cost-efficiency of software delivery — exactly the results you need to launch your application in a month, not in a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly,  DevOps is a practical implementation of Agile methodology, meaning you can </span><b>get an MVP</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a Minimum Viable Product) for your delivery service application </span><b>in a week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  release it to stay in touch with your frequenters and improve it further to acquire new customers. This can be an essential step to overcoming the quarantine crisis and successfully growing afterward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to make it happen then?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact a reliable DevOps as a service company like IT Svit, who will be able to provide end-to-end software delivery services and enable MVP development and ongoing DevOps support.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the world on quarantine, there is a high demand for video streaming services and online education platforms and IT Svit has the needed DevOps expertise to deploy them.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7611"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video streaming in general, and its subset dedicated to online education in particular, is on the ever-increasing demand for the last decade. YouTube is not all about gaming and funny cats videos — it is full of useful videos covering all aspects of education, from roasting steaks and baking pies to programming and DIY projects like making a shingle roof with your own hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, many people need to have certificates proving their knowledge, and YouTube does not issue ones. On the other hand, there are platforms dedicated specifically to online education — like Open edX, Coursera, Moodle, Udemy and others. These solutions offer access to a huge variety of courses from world-leading universities and individual experts, and videos form a huge part of educational materials used there. One such hundred hours-long course can have several dozens of gigabytes worth of video materials, and eLearning platforms usually provide thousands of courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, there is a need to build infrastructure for eLearning platforms, capable of handling thousands of learners instantaneously, store terabytes of learning materials, provide secure access to ensure the safety of financial details for learners and educators who will pay for certificates and get paid for uploading courses and tutoring students, etc.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for enabling video streaming services — companies big and small need them to stay connected to their personnel and provide access to their video conferencing products and service to their customers. Thus said, both video streaming and online education require building secure, easily scalable and highly resilient systems, which is exactly what <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps expertise</a> is all about.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7613" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Itsvit_Video-Streaming_Why-do-you-need-DevOps_2.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Itsvit_Video-Streaming_Why-do-you-need-DevOps_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Itsvit_Video-Streaming_Why-do-you-need-DevOps_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2>Why do you need DevOps for video streaming and online education?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether your product or service involves enabling online conferencing for your customers or provides streaming/restreaming, this platform will have specific needs and characteristics:</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the whole countries on lockdown and quarantine, the delivery services face a boom in popularity. Adopting DevOps for delivery services is crucial to ensure the stability of operations.</span><span id="more-7608"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report on the global coronavirus traffic impact, published in March 2020 by SimilarWeb, food and grocery delivery services have seen a 20% increase in YoY traffic after the quarantine was enacted in the EU and US. It is safe to say that until the quarantine is lifted, such services will see an increased demand — so if you are providing food or grocery delivery services and interact with your customers online — it is crucial to ensure stable operations of your web systems and applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where DevOps comes into action, helping any business, interacting with its customers online and handling their payments through web and mobile apps ensure secure, stable and resilient daily infrastructure operations along with rapid development and release of new applications and services. But how can a business get DevOps for delivery services in the most cost-efficient way? Let’s take a look!</span></p>
<h2><b>DevOps benefits for delivery services and any other business</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, what is <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps</a>? In short, DevOps is a software development and infrastructure management methodology, a practical implementation of Agile philosophy, concentrating on automating routine tasks to minimize time and effort to deliver and support a working product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is it so great? Because in our rapidly changing world the businesses cannot allow themselves the luxury of releasing new product versions once a year or two. The market is flooded with alternatives, and if you need 6 months to implement a new feature, your customers will swap the provider and use services from a competitor that updates their product monthly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for operational stability — would you rely on service that lags and crashes all the time? We doubt it, so it is crucial to ensure your product or service is available 24/7 and does not suffer from post-release crashes. Nobody has got time to wait for 20 hours while your team builds a hotfix after a faulty update, they just download the competitor’s app from Google Play or App Store.</span></p>
<h3><b>Thus said, what does DevOps actually do?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In DevOps workflows, operations engineers dictate the way to organize infrastructure and workflows optimally, ensuring minimal resource consumption and achievement of business goals set. There is no “throwing the code over the wall” paradigm. Devs, Ops and QA sit and discuss how they can help each other do their work faster and in the most efficient manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to always keep in mind, that building a product or application takes around 10-15% of its life span, testing it around 5-10%, and the remaining ~80% of the time the app works in production. Therefore, operational stability and simplicity should be the primary concern when building any product or service — so the Ops engineers have the final say in all decisions related to software delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the product be monolith or split into microservices? Should it run in the cloud or on dedicated servers? What release strategy to choose to ensure seamless updates? These and many more questions directly affecting the CAPEX, OPEX and overall business success must be answered prior to beginning the project — and experienced DevOps engineers have the knowledge and tools needed to make the best decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps teams build IaC — </span><b>Infrastructure as Code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where all variables of all system environments are configured through text documents — manifests processed by DevOps tools like Terraform and Kubernetes, so any developer can create any needed environment with ease, greatly reducing the software development time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of building new products and features works under CI/CD — </span><b>Continuous Integration and Delivery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approach — all interim operations are automated and tools like Ansible and Jenkins help form so-called pipelines — automated scenarios, where the output of the previous operation becomes the input for the next operation. This allows automating multiple manual actions, freeing up time, effort and creativity required to improve the efficiency of your operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sum it up, adopting a DevOps approach will help your business become more versatile and resilient, so this time of crisis becomes your window of opportunity. But how to get access to DevOps talent?</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7615" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ITsvit_delivery_How-to-hire_2-1.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ITsvit_delivery_How-to-hire_2-1.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ITsvit_delivery_How-to-hire_2-1-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2><b>How to hire DevOps expertise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three common approaches to hiring DevOps expertise:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in house/freelance,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from cloud computing providers and their affiliated partners</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from IT outsourcing companies.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are benefits and downsides to all of these approaches, so let’s take a closer look at each of them</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring a DevOps engineer to your team locally or as a remote freelancer is a viable approach under normal circumstances. You get access to a DevOps expert and can completely control his/her workload, select the tools they use and the tasks they work on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the reality of quarantine, hiring a skilled DevOps engineer in-house is literally impossible, unless your delivery business is located in one of the major startup hubs, and entrusting your mission-critical systems to a freelancer, whose working hours can differ from yours is not the wisest business decision.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with  DevOps experts from cloud computing providers and their affiliate partners ensures professionalism and quality of services. However, this also ensures vendor lock-in, as these specialists will definitely use platform-specific tools when building your infrastructure and processes, so moving to another platform should need be would require building everything from scratch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing to Managed DevOps services providers like IT Svit grants instant access to skilled professionals with rich experience in delivering projects similar to yours. Unlike freelancers, such teams are legally bound by SLA, NDA and contractual obligations, ensuring security and predictability of your project delivery. They will also use open-source tools to ensure your systems are modular and can be easily moved to another cloud platform if need be. The only issue here is the risk of contracting the unreliable company that will not be able to accomplish on time the tasks you need to be done.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to avoid this? Work with reputed contractors, who have multiple positive customer reviews, ranked as leaders by independent rating agencies and have successfully solved projects similar to yours. This will ensure that even in the midst of pandemic and crisis your business will be able to stand up to the challenges and overcome them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you need assistance — IT Svit is always ready to help!</span></p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/devops-for-delivery-services/">DevOps for delivery services</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps for healthcare has never been more important than in the midst of pandemic and quarantine. Read on to know why DevOps is the best choice and how to do it right. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-7605"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare has always been a very demanding industry, with a heavy emphasis on customer details privacy and security of data processing. HIPAA compliance is quite a complex thing to implement and uphold, especially given the inadequacy of legacy infrastructure many healthcare providers are forced to operate. Transition to the cloud and DevOps adoption can be the answer to these challenges — and doubly so in times like these, when COVID-19 pandemic and global quarantine forces healthcare providers to allocate their resources most cost-efficiently. Today we explain how DevOps helps ensure security and cost-efficiency of IT operations in healthcare and why working with Managed Services Providers is the best choice for this task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 pandemic on the loose, the pressure on all healthcare providers is multiplied, as all hospitals have to be ready to treat the patients infected with the coronavirus. The problem here is that it is becoming obvious that the quarantine will not be lifted by April or May. Some of the leading German and US virologists say COVID-19 outbreak will be active at least until autumn and will return in waves throughout the next 2 years. Thus, healthcare facilities across the globe will have to handle waves after waves of infected patients until the vaccine is developed, and this is a year away at the earliest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the treatment does not come for free, so the patients should be able to keep their bills paid, which means enacting their insurance or getting paid for the services provided. This, in turn, means that their financial and personal details must be securely stored and processed by hospital IT systems. Unfortunately, most established healthcare institutions worldwide have mainframe systems built decades ago, which were never meant to deal with the challenge like coronavirus — not only in terms of data storage capacity or security but also in terms of data throughput intensity, as this pandemic crisis will have several key differences from any other you have previously experienced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global quarantine means the inability (or big hurdles) for foreign specialists to visit your facility in person — so you need to be able to communicate with them online and use their assistance through teleconferencing and other means of online communication.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for telemedicine as many patients with pathologies and various disabilities will not be able to visit your clinic or hospital in person, so examining and consulting them online can be the only way to help them fight their illnesses.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Worldwide Healthcare Organization asks all healthcare organizations involved in fighting the COVID-19 outbreak to provide their data on the treatment, as applying Machine Learning models to analyzing this vast expanse of data can be vital for finding the cure faster. There already are AI solutions for providing diagnosis faster, but they must be trained on huge volumes of historical data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While maintaining the AI farms required for delivering these calculations is a costly deal available only to industry-leading farmaceutical corporations and healthcare organizations, every healthcare facility worldwide can become an endpoint for uploading such data to the cloud, thus doing their part in fighting the pandemic. Your systems should just be able to connect to the cloud via API, scale up and down on-demand and upload large volumes of data seamlessly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, in order to sufficiently meet and overcome the upcoming challenges, your IT infrastructure must be scalable, secure, flexible and resilient. What’s worse, if it isn’t that way now, you have only a limited time to do this, before the pandemic strikes in earnest. This is where <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps</a> comes into action!</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7607" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Itsvit_DevOps-for-Healthcare_cover_DevOps-for-healthcare_2.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Itsvit_DevOps-for-Healthcare_cover_DevOps-for-healthcare_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Itsvit_DevOps-for-Healthcare_cover_DevOps-for-healthcare_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2>DevOps for healthcare: we can help you prepare for fighting the COVID-19!</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps is an approach to handling software development and infrastructure management operations, centered at automating the routine tasks to free up time and effort needed for improving the systems and processes, removing the bottlenecks and ensuring the stability of operations under heavy workloads. DevOps is not a tool, neither is it a skillset — it is a mindset, a culture of using certain toolchains and workflows to improve the efficiency of IT operations in general. It cannot be bought quickly, but you can gain access to it in one of three major ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can hire a DevOps specialist in-house locally or as a remote freelancer. Both of these choices were viable until March 2020, but are quite impossible nowadays and for the foreseeable future. First of all, it is not prudent to trust your secure customer data to an outsider without any legal backup, regardless of their rating on TopTal. secondly, most DevOps engineers live in large startup hubs like the Valley, MIT or Frisco, and relocating them to your location can not be an option.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, hiring a DevOps engineer for the healthcare industry can be quite risky, if the specialist does not have the required background and expertise like HIPAA compliance. This process might also take quite long, and time is a luxury we cannot afford to spend during the pandemic.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why many companies and organizations opt for DevOps adoption as a managed service from their cloud computing providers. It is a decent option in terms of HIPAA compliance, expertise reliability and instant access to skilled professionals. However, working with technical support from cloud service providers or their affiliated partners means going for vendor lock-in and using their platform-specific tools to build your infrastructures and processes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this approach means your requests will be handled in a common queue with tickets from thousands of other AWS, GCP or Azure customers. For instance, while 4 hours until the response is considered a normal time covered by SLA, it is clearly not fast enough if your data upload to the cloud fails. Most importantly, platform-specific services are designed to work in bundles and you have to pay for the whole batch, even if your processes require only some system components and the rest can be safely replaced with open-source alternatives. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third possibility is working with Managed DevOps Services Providers like IT Svit, and this approach combines the benefits of two others without any of their downsides. When getting your DevOps services from and IT outsourcing provider, you get instant access to a pool of professionals with ample experience in the tasks you need to be performed. You sign a legally binding contract,  NDA and SLA, protecting your rights and interests of both parties.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT outsourcing teams prefer working with open-source tools to build flexible modular systems, where every cloud platform-specific component can be replaced on demand. This helps minimize your operational expenses and ensures resilience of operations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, a dedicated DevOps team can be easily hired to deliver the needed infrastructure and build processes and then you simply part ways with no hard feelings, once both parties fulfill their contractual obligations. Should you ever need other DevOps services — you can hire the same or another team with ease.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To wrap it up — oncoming pandemic requires maximum efficiency from all parts of healthcare operations and processes, including the IT environment. DevOps is the best approach for ensuring reliability and resilience of IT operations — and working with Managed DevOps Services Providers like IT Svit is the most cost-efficient way of gaining access to DevOps expertise. Should you need assistance with DevOps for your healthcare company or organization — let us know, we are always ready to help!</span></p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/devops-for-healthcare-in-the-midst-of-pandemic-and-quarantine/">DevOps for Healthcare in the midst of pandemic and quarantine</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DevOps is a mindset and culture of software delivery and IT operations based on Agile methodology and principles that revolutionized the way we develop software 10 years ago. Nowadays, there are multiple benefits of adopting DevOps in the telecom industry, especially in terms of building 5G networks. We explain these below.</p>
<p><span id="more-5999"></span></p>
<p>Traditional telecom networks are composed of specialized hardware that is built according to rigid specifications. Once the technology improves, the old equipment becomes obsolete and has to be replaced with the network hardware of new generation. This has happened 4 times already, thus the coming generation of telecommunication equipment is called 5G — and it is totally different from the generations that came before.</p>
<p>Instead of being designed and manufactured according to rigid specifications to form preconfigured systems, 5G networks will be based on software and run atop standard commodity hardware. This will allow providing high bandwidth, low latency and ease of configurability for multiple use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>IoT networks, Industry 4.0 and edge computing</li>
<li>Smart cities and traffic control</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence platforms</li>
<li>Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality and 3D video</li>
<li>Self-driving cars and smart highways and railroads, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, 5G is a welcomed leap up for mobile connectivity and Internet access worldwide. Naturally, these use cases differ immensely, and the infrastructure must be able to support a huge variety of requirements, providing resilience and ease of configuration. Implementing all of this through hardware is impossible, so software delivery principles come into play.</p>
<p>5G is built around three main principles SDN, NFV, and VNF.</p>
<ul>
<li>SDN stands for Software-Defined Networking, meaning all configuration is delivered through virtualized software, so it is centrally controllable and easily adjustable.</li>
<li>NFV stands for Network Functions Virtualization, meaning that instead of specialized hardware and appliances, these functions are performed with containerized apps deployed to Docker containers</li>
<li>VNF stands for Virtual Network Functions, meaning that the required NFV can be launched quickly, as it is a simple software deployment to commodity hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, the era of heavily investing in manufacturing, installment, and configuration of immense networks of hardware appliances is over. All the telecom operators have to do is renting public cloud computing resources and install the edge computing nodes where needed, which then connect to their main servers in the cloud. This provides unlimited capabilities to quickly deploy and configure the required infrastructure — and here is where the DevOps comes to the table.</p>

<h2>Applications of DevOps in the telecom sector</h2>
<p>Utilizing DevOps principles to manage the IT infrastructure composed of containers with NFV applications emulating the network appliances provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>transparent and efficient control over the network</li>
<li>removal of manual configuration of network hardware and appliances</li>
<li>Greatly reduced CAPEX</li>
<li>Network high-availability, scalability, and resilience</li>
<li>Real-time orchestration of network resources</li>
<li>Shortening of time-to-market for new apps, features, and solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Containerizing will be great for essential features like firewall functionality, CDN (Content Delivery Network), Network Address Translation mechanism (NAT), traffic routing, and even broadband remote server address (BRAS) modules. All of these can be codified and packed into neat little code containers that can be easily managed through 3 main DevOps principles — IaC, CI and CD.</p>
<ul>
<li>IaC or Infrastructure as Code — an approach to IT infrastructure orchestration, where each required infrastructure is described with declarative language in textual files, so-called “manifests”. These manifests are processed by infrastructure orchestration and configuration management platforms like Terraform and Kubernetes, which allow designing, implementing and running the infrastructure with ease.This approach ensures the uniformity of environment configurations across the software delivery process, minimizing the time-to-market for new product features, and helps minimize the numbers of code bugs due to the lack of configuration drift. Any environment settings can be versioned and stored in GitHub like any other code.This way, it can be provisioned, managed, adjusted, and deleted in seconds, instead of time-consuming repairs and reconfiguration after failures. Not to mention the failures like release crashes happen far less often, and recovery from them is nowhere as hard as it used to be.</li>
<li>CI or Continuous Integration. This means that all code and configuration updates are done in smaller chunks, rather than in larger batches. This ensures the code is cleaner, there are less integration bugs, the time-to-market of new products is much shorter and updates to your Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) are delivered on a predictable and reliable schedule. This is ensured through the use of the tools like Gitlab CI, Circle CI, Jenkins and other.</li>
<li>CD or Continuous Delivery. This is the approach to automating as many repetitive, labor-intensive and error-prone IT infrastructure management operations, as possible. Thus said, when the CD pipeline is configured correctly, your IT department can concentrate on actually improving your business efficiency, instead of doing the same tedious configuration tasks again and again. The software delivery life cycle is much more predictable and manageable this way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DevOps benefits for 5G telecom operators</h2>
<p>As we mentioned before, the VNFs are software emulations of hardware appliances forming the network. Using such virtualized apps allows composing multifacet infrastructures with modules provided by various vendors, sometimes having multitenancy and interoperability issues. The more the variety of VNFs, the more the complexity of the NFV systems, obviously. This is how adopting DevOps in the telecom industry can help operations and development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each VNF can be containerized to run in a Docker container atop a Kubernetes cluster. This ensures improved interoperability and simplifies multitenancy, as the hardware resources needed to support such a system are greatly lower, as compared to classical networks.</li>
<li>Each system function can be separated into a microservice, effectively turning a maze of interdependencies to streamlined workflows with the exchange of messages between components through the APIs.</li>
<li>Terraform and Kubernetes clusters have built-in options for monitoring and simple orchestration of containers with VNFs</li>
<li>The modular structure ensures interoperability and portability to various NFV environments, so you can use the same building blocks to compose any telecom network your current project needs — virtually and very quickly.</li>
<li>A service mesh is a layer of Kubernetes clusters that can be operated as a whole using Helm charts and other tools, further simplifying the management of the entire service for enterprise telecom operations managers</li>
<li>Cloud-native deployment of such networks under DevOps model enables simple integration of Big Data analytics, which can be used to 2 major ends: both enabling automated infrastructure management under the AI overseer (autoscaling up and down based on workloads, automatic backups, seamless updates and releases, etc), and in-depth analysis of your workflows and machine-generated logs using ELK stack, Sumologic, Splunk, Prometheus and Grafana and other tools alike.</li>
</ul>
<p>The transition to DevOps model of telecom product development is best demonstrated through the skyrocketing popularity of the web and mobile interfaces for accessing and managing all kinds of telecom networks and equipment, not to mention the browser-based services that run on this infrastructure. This would have not been possible without the transition from Waterfall to Agile methodology of software delivery life cycle.</p>
<p>However, the workloads  and the competition are only going to increase, as the telecom industry is expected to provide stable 5G coverage not only in developed countries but for 2 more billions of mobile users in Indonesia and South America, who are expected to go online during the next 5 years, as stated in a <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/report/Making-5G-pay">report from PWC</a>, a world-known business analyst and publisher agency.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5931 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ItSvit_devops-telecom_conclusion_4.png" alt="" width="1338" height="700" /></p>
<h2>Conclusions on the perspectives of DevOps in the telecom sector</h2>
<p>Nearly $57 billion USD as revenue from mobile technology implementation is expected to be the award for the best mobile coverage provided by the telecom operators. Thus said, efficient DevOps implementation in the telecom sector is the question of gaining a competitive advantage and securing a leading market position in the years to come.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the existing 4G hardware and infrastructure can be used for provisioning the 5G coverage, so there is no need in huge CAPEX on hardware updates. The only requirement is to update the networks properly, utilizing the DevOps benefits to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>How to do it then? Obviously, if the telecom operator lacks the required DevOps expertise, the most obvious solution is outsourcing the project to one of the <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/msp">top 10 reputable Managed Services Providers worldwide</a>, who are able to lend their services to help your company transform and future-proof it for 5G.</p>
<p>Should you like to do it on your own — IT Svit wishes you all the best and sincerely hopes you succeed. Should you decide to wait a bit more — no problem with that either, your more tech-savvy competitors will prevail. After all, as the famous W. Edwards.Deming quote goes, “It is not necessary to change. Your company survival is not mandatory”</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/benefits-of-adopting-devops-in-the-telecom-industry/">Benefits of adopting DevOps in the telecom industry</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>
