										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various food delivery companies in the US and worldwide move their operations to the cloud to gain more operational flexibility. IT Svit helps achieve this result and provides dedicated teams that configure the cloud for food delivery businesses.</span><span id="more-7846"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food delivery is a highly competitive business that must be flexible to ensure quick stock turnover and cost-efficient operations. Running IT operations systems in the cloud is obviously the best choice for a food delivery service. IT Svit helps configure cloud services for food delivery applications to ensure maximum resilience, scalability and high-availability of your operations.</span></p>
<h2>Infrastructure<b> management and cloud backup for food delivery companies</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personnel of food delivery companies must be able to access your systems from the office, from their smartphones or tablets in the cars or even get notifications to their smartwatches. This means your app must run in the cloud to ensure ease and speed of access, high velocity of information updates and secure cloud backup for operational data. IT Svit helps configure cloud services for food delivery apps for top-notch performance.</span></p>
<h2>Optimizing<b> cloud computing for food delivery app development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To remain competitive and ensure uninterrupted value delivery for both your team and your customers, you should ensure the feedback loops are as short as possible. This means the process of implementing feedback and adding new features must take the least time. This is possible if your team benefits from CI/CD pipelines powered by cloud computing features. IT Svit can configure these pipelines to minimize the time-to-market for your product updates.</span></p>
<h2><b>We</b> provide<b> managed cloud services for food delivery companies</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fast-paced business world of the 21st century, the only way for a business to survive and succeed is to remain competitive and utilize every possible advantage. <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/cloud-computing/">Cloud computing</a> is one of such advantages, quickly becoming a necessity for goal-oriented businesses. By running applications and systems in the cloud, every company ensures resilience and security, manageability and cost-efficiency of operations. This is especially so for food delivery services, as successfully running such a business requires using a complex software ecosystem spanning both office workspaces and mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your delivery trucks must get live updates on the traffic situation and the resupply schedule during the day. Your office personnel must keep track of the food supplies in the warehouses and direct the trucks there in such a way as to ensure optimal loading speed and traveling routes. Your teams must remain in touch all the time in case the situation changes rapidly, etc. It is obvious that the reliability and speed of software operations and communication systems are essential for the success of such a business.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7849" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_advantages_2.png" alt="" width="1141" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_advantages_2.png 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_advantages_2-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing provides all the advantages listed above — if one has the expertise required to leverage them.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Scalability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cloud resources are rented in virtual instances with configurable quotas. These quotas can be increased on-demand, ensuring your business always has exactly as many resources as it needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cloud platforms provide a wide variety of security features, both structural — like private subnets and bastion hosts or Docker containers, and procedural, like Google Stackdriver or Amazon CloudWatch web services. Storing data in the cloud is the most secure way of keeping your sensitive information (like billing data and personal details of your customers) safe.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>High-availability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike dedicated servers with limited throughput, cloud virtual machines provide literally unlimited connectivity. Most importantly, your applications can run in the cloud availability zones closets to your area of operations to ensure minimal latency and stable uplink for all the devices involved.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cost-efficiency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cloud services are rented under the Pay-As-You-Go billing model, meaning you pay only for the resources consumed. Thus said, you can configure your cloud instances to provide the absolute minimum of resources required to run your systems and develop your applications. Then you can easily scale the system up and down as needed, to ensure maximum cost-efficiency of your cloud investments — unlike dedicated bare-metal servers, which you buy or rent and pay for their operations 24/7, regardless of if you actually use them to full capacity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Predictability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Due to <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps automation</a> of cloud infrastructure management, you can minimize the time needed to provision and configure new virtual environments or perform some routine operations, like cloud backup for food delivery apps. Therefore, the software development process becomes much more reliable and predictable, allowing you to implement customer feedback and update your systems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7848" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_principles_3.png" alt="" width="1141" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_principles_3.png 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Delivery-cloud_principles_3-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this is possible due to three basic DevOps principles that enable the automation of software delivery and infrastructure management operations: IaC, CI and CD.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IaC means </span><b>Infrastructure as Code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Settings and parameters of all infrastructure environments are codified in a form of textual configuration files, so-called manifests. These manifests are written in simple descriptive language, stored at some Version Control System and can be versioned like any other code. Thus said, a DevOps engineer can prepare these manifests for all repetitive scenarios and easily adjust them to meet the changing requirements. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This simplifies software development and infrastructure management immensely, as all it takes a developer to load the required testing environment and perform automated unit and integrity testing for a new batch of code is just loading the required manifest in a single click. No need to wait for the Ops engineer to provision and configure the required server — and no need for you to pay for this server while it is on standby.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, IaC solves the “works on my machine” conundrum, as all the environments are built automatically, using the same Docker images and run in the same Docker containers, so there are no discrepancies between the IDE, testing, staging and production environments and the code works exactly the same on every stage of delivery. This removes the risk of major bugs making it to production and causing post-release system crashes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CI means</span><b> Continuous Integration</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This principle declares that instead of splitting the project into several long branches and merging them before the release (causing several bugs, some of which can make it to production), your application is developed in small chunks, where new batches of code are continuously integrated into the main project trunk. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is enabled by IaC, as instead of running a hard-to-reconfigure test server farm, your development team provisions testing environments for themselves in a matter of seconds, uses them to perform automated unit and integrity code tests and pushes the code to the staging server for high-level testing by QA engineers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This principle works for feedback loops as well, as automating the software delivery and testing through IaC and CI enables you to implement new features based on customer feedback and stakeholder input quite rapidly, in weeks instead of months.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CD means </span><b>Continuous Delivery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is the second part of a CI/CD pipeline, an ability to configure the DevOps toolkit and a bunch of cloud-specific web services in such a way, that the outcome of every operation becomes the input of the next operation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the commit of a new batch of code to the repository launches the appropriate manifest, which creates the required testing environment and the code is run against the automated tests. If the tests succeed, the code is automatically pushed to the staging server, where the latest application build is prepared for testing. If the tests fail, the alert is raised to the developer and the code is given back for bugfixes, reverting the commit. The testing environments are then decommissioned to save resources, till the next time, as it takes only a couple of seconds.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same approach works for infrastructure management, where multiple operations like cloud backup for food delivery applications and data can be done completely automatically.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in order to use these benefits to the full extent, your business must have access to skilled DevOps engineers, who can configure cloud computing for food delivery businesses.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a secret that demand for food delivery grew </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immensely with the quarantine going on. Online food delivery platforms face huge loads of traffic these days, the majority of web and mobile applications hardly ready to handle the demand. DevOps can help with smooth experience for users, prevent downtime and much more.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7799"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 outbreak that grew into a pandemic and forced nearly all of the world to go on quarantine. . This means citizens are unable to visit a restaurant — but many restaurants have already got their delivery services operating before the quarantine. The challenge now is to handle the increased traffic and ensure system resilience under heavy workloads. Contracting DevOps for delivery services can help restaurants handle the changing operational landscape and turn this crisis into opportunity by providing a viable alternative to dining out for their customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does an online delivery service for a restaurant need? </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be able to receive orders from the website, from a mobile app, or even through a chatbot</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be able to handle various payment gateways</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must support the “forgotten cart” feature, reminding the customers of their unfinished orders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must store the history of previous orders for the purpose of analytics and enabling loyalty programs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these features can be enabled by the app itself, either through add-ons and plugins or through a custom functionality — given time. And time is a luxury we cannot afford to waste right now, as the world is awakening from slumber and realizing it can work, learn, relax and order food online while being efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, All Set Now, a Ukrainian startup that has currently connected more than 2,500+ restaurants in 12 cities across the USA. Participating in All Set Now partner network has enabled these establishments to grow their delivery revenue and increase their table turnover by 200%, while their customers live a healthier and happier life, being able to order any meals quicker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just the beginning of literally endless possibilities your business can unlock if you decide to utilize this situation to the max. Using AR/VR to provide a preview of a custom meal for your clients? With ease! Leveraging voice assistants to form orders? Not a problem. Modern technology allows being as innovative as you wish within the timeframes and budget limits you have. And this is where the hard part begins — as quarantine means the absence of visitors, thus you have very limited time and budget before you are forced to go bankrupt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where DevOps can be a lifesaver, allowing your restaurant business to quickly develop and launch a bespoke delivery service solution to cater to the needs of your frequenters and enable them to continue eating the meals they love but cannot cook at home.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7801" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ItSvit_DevOps-for-delivery_What-is-DevOps-anyways_2.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ItSvit_DevOps-for-delivery_What-is-DevOps-anyways_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ItSvit_DevOps-for-delivery_What-is-DevOps-anyways_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2><b>What is DevOps anyways? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps is a methodology of software development and cloud infrastructure management enabling the businesses to deliver apps and manage them in production in a quick and cost-efficient way. This is achieved through automation of repetitive tasks and building CI/CD pipelines, where the IT systems supporting your operations can run with little effort and supervision from your team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is even more important for restaurants, who normally don’t have a software development team in-house, DevOps services providers can also field dedicated teams of software engineers. This way you get instant access to teams of qualified specialists able to build an application for you and ensure it is done quickly and cost-efficiently. How is it done?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building and running any software in a production environment involves multiple repetitive operations, testing environment provisioning and new app version building being the most frequent and time-consuming. DevOps engineers automate this process through using toolchains like Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm and Docker to enable IaC — </span><b>Infrastructure as Code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With it, all the parameters and variables of every computing environment needed for developing your application are written down in simple descriptive language in a form of text files — so-called “manifests”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These manifests are stored on GitHub and can be accessed and versioned by any developer like any other code, so deploying a new version of any required environment requires only loading the corresponding manifest. This shortens the software delivery cycle by as much as 90% and allows building new products over the span of weeks and months, not years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step of the DevOps journey is using </span><b>CI/CD pipelines</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery processes. These are automated scenarios that use the output of a previous operation as an input for the next operation. Once configured, CI/CD pipelines ensure new code is can be automatically tested, built, pushed to the staging server, tested again and pushed to production with a single code commit, should the tests succeed. This ensures the speed and cost-efficiency of software delivery — exactly the results you need to launch your application in a month, not in a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly,  DevOps is a practical implementation of Agile methodology, meaning you can </span><b>get an MVP</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a Minimum Viable Product) for your delivery service application </span><b>in a week</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  release it to stay in touch with your frequenters and improve it further to acquire new customers. This can be an essential step to overcoming the quarantine crisis and successfully growing afterward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to make it happen then?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact a reliable DevOps as a service company like IT Svit, who will be able to provide end-to-end software delivery services and enable MVP development and ongoing DevOps support.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the whole countries on lockdown and quarantine, the delivery services face a boom in popularity. Adopting DevOps for delivery services is crucial to ensure the stability of operations.</span><span id="more-7608"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report on the global coronavirus traffic impact, published in March 2020 by SimilarWeb, food and grocery delivery services have seen a 20% increase in YoY traffic after the quarantine was enacted in the EU and US. It is safe to say that until the quarantine is lifted, such services will see an increased demand — so if you are providing food or grocery delivery services and interact with your customers online — it is crucial to ensure stable operations of your web systems and applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where DevOps comes into action, helping any business, interacting with its customers online and handling their payments through web and mobile apps ensure secure, stable and resilient daily infrastructure operations along with rapid development and release of new applications and services. But how can a business get DevOps for delivery services in the most cost-efficient way? Let’s take a look!</span></p>
<h2><b>DevOps benefits for delivery services and any other business</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, what is <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps</a>? In short, DevOps is a software development and infrastructure management methodology, a practical implementation of Agile philosophy, concentrating on automating routine tasks to minimize time and effort to deliver and support a working product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is it so great? Because in our rapidly changing world the businesses cannot allow themselves the luxury of releasing new product versions once a year or two. The market is flooded with alternatives, and if you need 6 months to implement a new feature, your customers will swap the provider and use services from a competitor that updates their product monthly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for operational stability — would you rely on service that lags and crashes all the time? We doubt it, so it is crucial to ensure your product or service is available 24/7 and does not suffer from post-release crashes. Nobody has got time to wait for 20 hours while your team builds a hotfix after a faulty update, they just download the competitor’s app from Google Play or App Store.</span></p>
<h3><b>Thus said, what does DevOps actually do?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In DevOps workflows, operations engineers dictate the way to organize infrastructure and workflows optimally, ensuring minimal resource consumption and achievement of business goals set. There is no “throwing the code over the wall” paradigm. Devs, Ops and QA sit and discuss how they can help each other do their work faster and in the most efficient manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to always keep in mind, that building a product or application takes around 10-15% of its life span, testing it around 5-10%, and the remaining ~80% of the time the app works in production. Therefore, operational stability and simplicity should be the primary concern when building any product or service — so the Ops engineers have the final say in all decisions related to software delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should the product be monolith or split into microservices? Should it run in the cloud or on dedicated servers? What release strategy to choose to ensure seamless updates? These and many more questions directly affecting the CAPEX, OPEX and overall business success must be answered prior to beginning the project — and experienced DevOps engineers have the knowledge and tools needed to make the best decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps teams build IaC — </span><b>Infrastructure as Code</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where all variables of all system environments are configured through text documents — manifests processed by DevOps tools like Terraform and Kubernetes, so any developer can create any needed environment with ease, greatly reducing the software development time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of building new products and features works under CI/CD — </span><b>Continuous Integration and Delivery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approach — all interim operations are automated and tools like Ansible and Jenkins help form so-called pipelines — automated scenarios, where the output of the previous operation becomes the input for the next operation. This allows automating multiple manual actions, freeing up time, effort and creativity required to improve the efficiency of your operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sum it up, adopting a DevOps approach will help your business become more versatile and resilient, so this time of crisis becomes your window of opportunity. But how to get access to DevOps talent?</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7615" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ITsvit_delivery_How-to-hire_2-1.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ITsvit_delivery_How-to-hire_2-1.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ITsvit_delivery_How-to-hire_2-1-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2><b>How to hire DevOps expertise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three common approaches to hiring DevOps expertise:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in house/freelance,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from cloud computing providers and their affiliated partners</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from IT outsourcing companies.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are benefits and downsides to all of these approaches, so let’s take a closer look at each of them</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring a DevOps engineer to your team locally or as a remote freelancer is a viable approach under normal circumstances. You get access to a DevOps expert and can completely control his/her workload, select the tools they use and the tasks they work on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the reality of quarantine, hiring a skilled DevOps engineer in-house is literally impossible, unless your delivery business is located in one of the major startup hubs, and entrusting your mission-critical systems to a freelancer, whose working hours can differ from yours is not the wisest business decision.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with  DevOps experts from cloud computing providers and their affiliate partners ensures professionalism and quality of services. However, this also ensures vendor lock-in, as these specialists will definitely use platform-specific tools when building your infrastructure and processes, so moving to another platform should need be would require building everything from scratch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing to Managed DevOps services providers like IT Svit grants instant access to skilled professionals with rich experience in delivering projects similar to yours. Unlike freelancers, such teams are legally bound by SLA, NDA and contractual obligations, ensuring security and predictability of your project delivery. They will also use open-source tools to ensure your systems are modular and can be easily moved to another cloud platform if need be. The only issue here is the risk of contracting the unreliable company that will not be able to accomplish on time the tasks you need to be done.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to avoid this? Work with reputed contractors, who have multiple positive customer reviews, ranked as leaders by independent rating agencies and have successfully solved projects similar to yours. This will ensure that even in the midst of pandemic and crisis your business will be able to stand up to the challenges and overcome them.</span></p>
