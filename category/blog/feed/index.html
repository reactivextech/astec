										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DevOps appeared 10+ years ago and has been growing in popularity since then. For many experts, DevOps might have different meanings. However, one way or another, everyone will admit that DevOps is all about shortening and simplifying software delivery processes to produce high-quality, customer-oriented products faster. </p>



<span id="more-8227"></span>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/whitepapers/devops-survey-2020">Atlassian’s research</a> conducted among 500 developers and IT leaders, 99% of responders said DevOps had a positive impact on their organization, boosting product/service quality, time-to-market, and teams’ productivity. That is why many IT businesses are eager to implement DevOps in their teams and find themselves searching for an easy way to do so. Frankly speaking, they have only two options &#8212; they either grow their own in-house DevOps team by hiring DevOps engineers or reach out to professional DevOps outsourcing companies to provide DevOps -as-a-service for them. If you are still deciding which option is for you, this article will be of major assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Insourcing DevOps? (There is no way)&nbsp; I can afford that!&nbsp;</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm">Glassdoor</a> – “DevOps Engineer” is among the top ten “Best Jobs in America in 2019” and it ranked sixth in terms of most wanted professionals. In <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/cx/2018/pdf/33-most-recruited-jobs.pdf">LinkedIn’s</a> 2018 poll of top recruited jobs, DevOps Engineer was number one! Do organizations want to hire DevOps engineers and grow their own DevOps teams? Of course, they do. What are the benefits of an <b>in-house DevOps team</b>? Your own DevOps team provides control over each phase of SDLC (software development lifecycle), your infrastructure is adjusted to your toolset and your team’s skillset. However, Atlassian’s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/whitepapers/devops-survey-2020">research</a> revealed that almost 85% of organizations faced various challenges when implementing DevOps related to the lack of skills of their employees, legacy infrastructure, or corp culture adjusting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It takes lots of resources to build a custom infrastructure and support the in-house DevOps team. According to <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Entry-Level-Devops-Engineer-Salary">Ziprecruiter</a>, at the moment, the salary of a beginner DevOps is about $87,000 a year. This means you pay a DevOps beginner about 7,300 US dollars a month (not including overheads and taxes), which is almost double the amount of the USA AVG salary. Of course, this is a very hard role. Not every ex-developer powered with excellent system administration skills can perform as a DevOps specialist. That’s why even if you are willing to pay such a salary, the hiring period is too long to bear, because if software engineer hiring time is <a href="https://www.focusgts.com/how-much-time-does-it-take-to-hire-a-software-engineer-in-2021/">64</a> days, with DevOps, the process is much longer and harder. Not to mention the hiring/onboarding spendings and here we do not only mean recruiter’s salary but also time managers waste on testing/interviewing potential candidates and onboarding new members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a matter of fact, big businesses might need an in-house DevOps in 20% of cases while small businesses and startups don’t have such cases at all. At the same time, DevOps specialists can help upskill employees in the teams, automate and optimize plenty of crucial processes. Plus, not every company can afford time and energy-consuming hiring for DevOps. If this is your case, outsourcing is a solution. What’s more, you can save even more costs, if you search for DevOps professionals from countries with still emerging markets, like Ukraine or Belarus, where the rates of highly-skilled professionals are much lower.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ItSvit_In-house_Deviopsa_2.gif" alt="Harry Potter DevOps" class="wp-image-8218"/></figure>



<h2>Outsourcing DevOps? It should be done right!&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A<b> DevOps outsourcing team</b> also has a number of benefits, such as allowing you to quickly deploy your products. Outsourcing DevOps team members are experienced in a variety of tasks and can handle a wide scope of unplanned situations.</p>



<p>You can save time/money on recruiting and onboarding new team members and therefore reduce the risk of staff turnover. At the same time, your employees are focused on the things that are more important to your business goals. In addition, if you are satisfied with the outcome of your cooperation, you prolong the partnership, if not, you can approach a new partner. So, basically, when dealing with DevOps-as-a-service companies you:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><b>Get a whole lot of IT services</b>. DevOps outsourcing teams are experienced in all phases of SDLC and provide a full range of services, including consulting for startups, SMB, and global corporations.</li><li><b>Get existing infrastructure improvement</b>. DevOps service providers will design and implement cloud infrastructure at any scale, supporting products and workflows from various industries.</li><li><b>Get a DevOps team as a service.</b> As the product grows and new features have to be added, many companies find the need to access talents they cannot easily obtain. IT-outstaffing helps sort this out.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Get management and beyond consulting</b>. You can approach mature DevOps outsourcing companies to get consulting services. Service providers will help you refine the idea of your product.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>However, some complex projects with very tight deadlines might be pretty expensive. Plus, you have to work out a communication process from scratch, which might be a kind of energy-consuming matter. At the same time, if you choose the right outsourcing company and properly prepare for the cooperation, you’ll get the best service and save resources.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1335" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Таблица.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8219" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Таблица.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Таблица-768x432.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Таблица-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Таблица-2048x1151.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<h2>DevOps-as-a-service company: where to find&nbsp;</h2>



<p>What sources can I use to find the most fitting for my organization DevOps-as-a-service company? How can I get information about it? Apart from delving deeply into Google search, you can reach out to trustworthy websites that assemble ratings which basically is a collection of genuine feedback on a company&#8217;s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of such independent services that receive honest reviews from unbiased reviewers is <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/cloud/leaders-matrix?facets=%2fit-services%2fcloud">Clutch. co</a>. Clutch is a self-sufficient platform that collects impartial customer reviews of every company that is listed on the site. They conduct in-depth interviews with customers and buyers about the quality of their interactions with each registered Clutch company. Based on the collected data, Clutch forms a fair rating of all firms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One more source you can turn to is the <a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/devops-companies/devops-as-a-service">GoodFirms</a> research platform that helps software service seekers to decide on the best company. At the same time, GoodFirms helps IT service companies improve user acquisition statistics, market share, and brand awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, you can always get all the necessary information on specialized websites like<a href="https://hackernoon.com/it-svit-is-atop-the-list-of-it-outsourcing-companies-in-ukraine-7cbfc816e8a3"> Hackernoon</a>, Medium, or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> where professionals post their expert articles including their opinions on service companies they have encountered.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ItSvit_In-house_hire-out_3.gif" alt="Hire vs Outsource" class="wp-image-8220"/></figure>



<h2>What if there is a balance between outsourcing and in-house DevOps?</h2>



<p>There are times when IT leaders do not switch from in-house IT services to outsourcing IT&nbsp; support but use them both. If you can afford to have both teams working for you, you can also benefit from this option. For example, it makes sense to keep the junior team within the company, and the senior one outsourced. In this case, you can split tasks between two teams and let them work on different projects at the same time. One more option is to address some particular tasks to mature DevOps professionals, for example, they can upgrade your existing infrastructure, support your team with documentation that will notably accelerate your deployment speed, reduce costs and enhance the team’s performance. With infrastructure improved once, outsourcing team’s services are no longer needed. How often do businesses try to balance between in-house and outsourced teams? Very often. You can examine various cases <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you decide you need a reliable DevOps service company to address some of your particular issues, here is what IT Svit DevOps team recommends to prepare before reaching out to DevOps-as-a-service partners:</p>



<ol><li>Define the processes you need to upgrade with DevOps-as-a-service. Set realistic goals and clear KPI&#8217;s. A great idea would be to match your particular goals with the DevOps service provider’s expertise.&nbsp;</li><li>Inspect the tech expertise. DevOps outsourcing companies might have different specializations such as in single or multi-cloud solutions, cloud migration, or security infrastructure designing and implementation. Choose the one that covers your specific needs.&nbsp;</li><li>Consider the tech stack DevOps service company has experience working with: AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Pay attention to the company’s portfolio, and choose a provider with a proven record of successful projects.</li><li>Mediate a win-win contract that covers all crucial aspects of the forthcoming partnership.&nbsp;</li><li>Be prepared for an audit of your existing environment from the DevOps team.</li></ol>



<h2>Final thoughts&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2016/02/17/when-is-the-right-time-to-hire-a-devops-engineer/?sh=2de258cac476">Forbes article</a> author compared DevOps implementation to “<em>changing gears</em>,” meaning that DevOps improvements are noticeable at each part of the engineering process, where engineers can focus entirely on the product, instead of covering routine assignments manually. The best DevOps engineers can streamline product development, smooth communication between distinct project teams, and save the company money. DevOps functions happen in the background, ensuring that all systems are constantly being monitored and are operational. Plus, in case of an issue, DevOps engineers operate as good problem-solvers. At the same time, hiring for DevOps is not a piece of cake. Many businesses cannot afford to waste months on hiring and onboarding periods. What’s more, it’s quite expensive to hire and support in-house DevOps engineers. With that, organizations address their issues to full-fledged DevOps professionals. We at IT Svit often power-up internal DevOps teams or become owners of DevOps processes for a client. So we’re happy to help in case you still have questions or decided to go with DevOps-as-a-service provider.

<h2>HashiCorp announcing Terraform 1.0 general availability</h2>



<p>On June 8th, 2021 HashiConf Europe announced the general availability of HashiCorp Terraform 1.0, a major tool for synergy, ease of upgrades, and support for your automation flows. Terraform 1.0 is immediately available for download as well as for use in HashiCorp Terraform Cloud. In this <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp-terraform-1-0-general-availability?utm_source=telegram.me&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=pozavchera-hashicorp-vypustili-pervuyu-sta">post, </a>you&#8217;ll take a look at what’s new, and what the 1.0 designation means for Terraform users.</p>



<p>Technically, this is the same version of 0.15.5 that came out a little earlier. However, now Hashicorp guarantees nothing will break in Terraform’s new releases &#8211; both in the language, the format of the government files and in the format of the program interface. There are some exceptions, though. Read this <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/v1-compatibility-promises.html?utm_source=telegram.me&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=pozavchera-hashicorp-vypustili-pervuyu-sta">post</a> for a complete list.</p>

<h2>What ‘s new with Grafana?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>June 8th became the date when Grafana Labs released <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2021/06/08/grafana-8.0-unified-grafana-and-prometheus-alerts-live-streaming-new-visualizations-and-more/">Grafana v8.0.</a>&nbsp; With Grafana you can create, explore and share all of your data through convenient and flexible dashboards. Grafana doesn’t require you to ingest data to a backend store or vendor database. Instead, Grafana takes a unique approach to provide a “single-pane-of-glass” by unifying your existing data, wherever it lives. With Grafana, you can take any of your existing data (Kubernetes cluster data, Raspberry Pi, different cloud services, or even Google Sheets,&nbsp; and visualize it from a single dashboard. By democratizing data, Grafana helps to facilitate a culture where data can easily be used and accessed by the people that need it, helping to break down data silos and empower teams. So, what’s new in Grafana v8.0:</p>



<ul><li>Integration with external alert systems with alert manager from Prometheus.</li><li>Packing charts into libraries for reuse on other dashboards.</li><li>Support for a push model for updating dashboards in real-time, for example, updating charts by events from MQTT or by HTTP POST to an endpoint in Grafana.</li><li>Several new types of visualization, data sources, and authentication.</li><li>Other minor changes. More information<a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v8-0/?utm_source=telegram.me&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nedavno-vyshla-grafana-8.0-grafa#whats-new-in-grafana-v80"> here</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>HTTP Performance Tuning: 1.2M API req/s on a 4 vCPU EC2 Instance</h2>



<p>In this<a href="https://talawah.io/blog/extreme-http-performance-tuning-one-point-two-million/"> post</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcarichards/">Marc Richards</a> will walk you through the performance tuning steps that he took to serve 1.2 million <a href="https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki/Project-Information-Framework-Tests-Overview#json-serialization">JSON &#8220;API&#8221; requests</a> per second from a 4 vCPU <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/">AWS EC2 instance</a>. For this recreated quest he was moving steadily from serving 224k req/s at the start, with the default configuration, to a mind-blowing 1.2M req/s by the time we reach the end. The main takeaway from this post should be an appreciation for the tools and techniques that can help you to profile and improve the performance of your systems. Though you probably should not expect to get a 5x performance boost from your web app by implementing these configuration changes. Many of the optimizations presented <a href="https://talawah.io/blog/extreme-http-performance-tuning-one-point-two-million/">here</a> won&#8217;t benefit you unless you are already serving more than 50k req/s, to begin with. On the other hand, applying the profiling techniques to any application should give you a much better understanding of its overall behavior, and you just might find an unexpected bottleneck.</p>



<h2>How Netflix uses eBPF flow logs at scale for network insight</h2>



<p>Netflix software infrastructure is a large distributed ecosystem that consists of specialized functional tiers that are operated on the AWS and Netflix-owned services. While they strive to keep the ecosystem simple, the inherent nature of leveraging a variety of technologies will lead us to challenges such as app dependencies and data flow mappings, pathway validation, service segmentation, and network availability. Cloud Network Insight is a suite of solutions that provides both operational and analytical insight into the cloud network infrastructure to address the identified problems. To that end, Netflix developed a network observability sidecar called <b>Flow Exporter</b> that uses eBPF tracepoints to capture TCP flows in near real-time. At much less than 1% of CPU and memory on the instance, this highly performant sidecar provides flow data at scale for network insight. Further details are <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-uses-ebpf-flow-logs-at-scale-for-network-insight-e3ea997dca96">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dog2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8205" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dog2.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dog2-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dog2-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dog2-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<h2>Awesome firewall management system presenting&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Need consistent network access rules across hundreds of servers in multiple regions on multiple providers? Need defense-in-depth, beyond gateway firewalls? Need blocklists with thousands of addresses distributed across many servers updated constantly? Need to limit the number of connections and/or bandwidth usage? Sick of error-prone manual updates of per-server iptables rules? You need a<b><em> </em></b><a href="https://relaypro-open.github.io/dog/"><b><em>Dog</em></b></a><b><em>.</em></b> The Dog is a distributed firewall management system designed to manage more than a hundred per-server firewalls. Currently, iptables on Linux are supported, but others could be added. The Dog is your network guard dog that can centrally manage hundreds (and more) of per-server iptables firewalls, work across clouds, regions, and on-premise infrastructure, adapt to dynamic address changes, alert if servers fail to communicate or if their firewalls are modified outside of the dog control, and many other quite helpful features.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Linux capabilities uncovering and exploiting&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Capabilities in Linux are special attributes that can be allocated to processes, binaries, services, and users and they can allow them specific privileges that are normally reserved for root-level actions. Capabilities are a powerful tool for system administrators and DevOps engineers to be able to do their job and work around some of the restrictions of the Linux operating system, however, they should be carefully set as if misconfigured they could lead to a full system compromise. In this <a href="https://steflan-security.com/linux-privilege-escalation-exploiting-capabilities/">article</a>, you will find a full list of Linux capabilities with a description, a danger list, tips on how to determine, and examples of privileges raising. Once the capabilities have been assigned, a great resource to find out if they can be vulnerable is through <a href="http://gtfobins.github.io/">GTFOBins</a>, as for each applicable binary it has a handy “Capabilities” section that shows how certain capabilities can be exploited to elevate privileges. This <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/linux-capabilities">HackTricks</a> page is also great. Alternatively, googling for the capability and the object it is assigned to normally does the trick.</p>



<h2>How you can best use etcd key-value store in your app</h2>



<p><a href="https://etcd.io">Etcd</a> is a distributed key/value store designed as a highly available and robustly coherent data store for distributed systems. Actually, Kubernetes itself uses etcd to store all of its cluster data, such as configurations and metadata. As with any system design, different architectural solutions lead to different trade-offs that affect the optimal way to use and operate the system. In this <a href="https://blog.px.dev/etcd-6-tips/">article</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/michelle_aimi">Michelle Nguyen</a> Principal Engineer at <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a>, Founding engineer <a href="https://px.dev">Pixie Labs</a> discusses the inner workings of etcd to help conclude about how to use this key and value store in your own application.</p>

<p>It’s been 19 years since <em>Amazon.com Web Services</em>, managed by Colin Bryar (later Andy Jassy) launched its first web services, opening up the Amazon.com platform to all IT specialists. While the cloud has changed a lot since that time, only one thing remained the same: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the foundation of a healthy AWS implementation. For something more than a fun-toy-app, IaC is the key pillar. You’ll hardly find experts running big-serious-stuff, who think letting people take shots in the dark on AWS consoles is the best way to go. The benefits that lead plenty of organizations to migrate to IaC are perpetual infrastructure, growth in the velocity of delivery, scalability, cost savings, and risk alleviation. Currently, it’s much faster not only to run all of the applications with an IaC tool but also utilize it with PoC, and get on with it. It takes nothing to come back to projects after a few weeks/months and quickly understand how things work from a familiar background/context. With that said, we need to learn what IaC tools are on the AWS deck and which one is good enough for you to choose.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>CloudFormation at your service</h2>



<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> (CFN), released in 2011, is a built-in IaC tool in the AWS Cloud Platform that provides an easy way to quickly and effectively manage a set of multiple AWS native resources and even third-party resources utilizing IaC. CloudFormation helps manage your resources scaling and automate management processes leveraging and integrating other AWS resources. In addition, AWS CloudFormation also allows you to use an open-source CLI to create your own resource providers to manage third-party application resources. With CloudFormation’s templates written in YAML and JSON, you just code your infrastructure from scratch leveraging the template language and operate the resources you designed in the pattern. What’s more, you can always roll back your infrastructure to the previous state in case of failures.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_Choosing-the-right-IaC_cloud_3-updated.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8183" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_Choosing-the-right-IaC_cloud_3-updated.jpg 1200w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_Choosing-the-right-IaC_cloud_3-updated-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>A little while ago, we only had <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html">Custom Resources</a> to provide and operate capabilities that CloudFormation did not natively support. The situation has now been largely improved by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html">Resource Providers</a>, which currently allow you to design individual providers to manage third-party resources in your stacks. For instance, you can easily utilize<a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-as-code-with-datadog-and-cloudformation/"> Datadog</a> (a monitoring tool) in your stack to provide and manage your supervision without the need for any extraneous process.</p>



<h2>Cloud Development Kit making an entrance</h2>



<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">AWS Cloud Development Kit</a> (CDK), a new addition to the AWS toolbox, was released in 2019. The main distinguishing feature of CDK is that developers can write IaC managing lines utilizing their familiar programming languages such as Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and others. At the same time, CDK is not replacing CloudFormation; it sort of incorporates CFN, absorbing a full pool of its advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One more brightly lit feature of CDK that CloudFormation lacked is upgraded modules which can be easily shared and re-used. CDK presents constructs that can provide a complex of services from wrapping some particular lapses up to complete re-orchestration with canceling all resource providers. Plus, CDK constructs feature another important compiler called <a href="https://github.com/aws/jsii">jsii</a> which allows any language code to easily interact with JavaScript classes. That in turn allows CDK to deliver multi-language libraries as a monolith code base. </p>



<h2>Terraform &#8212; a new approach to IaC</h2>



<p>As other IaC tools, Terraform utilizes configuration files to granularize infrastructure setup but takes a higher position promoting cloud independence and allowing multiple providers and services to be aggregated and merged. For instance, Terraform can be leveraged to orchestrate an AWS and OpenStack cluster at the same time while allowing third-party vendors such as CloudFlare and DNSimple to combine to provide CDN and DNS services. This allows Terraform to operate the entire infrastructure with its maintaining services, not just a subunit of the existing infrastructure within a single provider. It provides an original, consolidated syntax (<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl">Hashicorp Configuration Language</a> (HCL) instead of requiring DevOps engineers to utilize self-sufficient and incompatible tools for each platform and service.</p>



<p>Terraform also separates the planning stage from the execution stage utilizing the idea of an execution plan. With <em>terraform plan </em>running, the current state is updated and configuration is consulted on an action plan. The plan includes all the actions that need to be taken: what resources will be created, eliminated, or changed. DevOps engineers can test it to make sure it is ready to be implemented and approve the plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a terraform graph, you can visualize the plan to follow the dependencies. Once the plan has been drawn up, the execution phase can only be limited to activities in the plan. Other tools combine the planning/execution stages, which means engineers have to rely on their brains to introspectively contemplate the implications of a change that quickly becomes overwhelming in large infrastructures. With Terraform, DevOps engineers can feel confident applying changes because they know exactly what will happen in advance.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts: Which one to choose&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With an immense choice of tools presented and a huge variety of business requirements, it’s absolutely impossible to give one all-purpose solution. However, when contemplating your alternatives, evaluate these simple facts, and you’ll get the answers.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>My solution is quite simple and particularly serverless &#8212; <b>AWS CloudFormation</b> to help you (notably AWS SAM).</li><li>I vertically distribute best practices and orchestration &#8212; <b>Terraform / CDK</b>.</li><li>AWS is my final selection and I’ll stay with AWS &#8212; <b>CloudFormation / CDK</b>.</li><li>I want to orchestrate some resources outside AWS &#8212; <b>Terraform / </b><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/introducing-the-cloud-development-kit-for-terraform-preview/"><b>CDK for Terraform</b></a>.</li><li>I want to have a multi-cloud environment &#8212; <b>Terraform</b>.</li></ul>



<p>One way or another, choosing the right IaC tool on AWS is a quite demanding process involving plenty of thinking. However, no matter what you choose, the only truly wrong decision is not to use tools designed to streamline your software development and delivery processes at most. If you have any questions regarding what IaC tool to pick or any other <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps</a>-allied question you can always contact us. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In this article, we will encroach on the sacred &#8211;<b> </b><a href="https://www.jenkins.io"><b>Jenkins</b>!</a> But don’t get me wrong, we strongly appreciate Jenkins, it’s like a Swiss Army knife for any DevOps team. Jenkins is a powerful tool that helps us orchestrate any infrastructure we design. Even so, have you ever thought there might be something else? Well, there is &#8211; <a href="https://www.runatlantis.io"><b>Atlantis</b></a>, especially if we talk about infrastructure orchestration with Terraform. So, today we will discuss why Atlantis is helpful when we deal with infrastructure automation and orchestration with Terraform, but before we do, let&#8217;s talk about why IT companies need to automate their infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Infrastructure automation: what are the benefits?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Automation of all levels of SDLC (software development life cycle) has become a trending matter across the IT teams when DevOps stepped on the IT scene. With DevOps, it became possible for teams to design, deploy and support new environments within minutes, not days or even weeks. Here are the main benefits you can get from automated infrastructure:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><b>Reduced Costs.</b> Automated infrastructure releases teams from tedious, manual phases of software development and delivery processes, they focus on more creative tasks and organizations save on labor spending.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Increased Efficiency.</b> Automated processes are performed more effectively and accurately.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Improved Reliability.</b> Automated CI/CD significantly improves business agility, reliability, and ensures stable performance at all stages of SDLC.</li><li><b>Boosted Velocity. </b>Due to automation, time-to-market is significantly reduced and definitely has a very positive effect on customer’s experience.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Improved Collaboration and Productivity.</b> Automated processes help improve collaboration between teams, which leads to significant productivity improvement.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1141" height="596" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_Atlantis-updated.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8170" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_Atlantis-updated.jpg 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_Atlantis-updated-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></figure>



<h2>Does Jenkins have cons? No way!&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Although Jankins was created as the open-source automation server that provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating, it’s mostly used for CD purposes. It’s impossible that Jenkins had drawbacks, but there are some issues. Let’s examine the infrastructure flow steps with Jenkins.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Everything begins with a master (core) branch. We head to the Terraform git repo to create a master branch clone, amend it to implement Terraform configuration modifications, and commit/push them to the branch repo</li><li>Then extend a pull request to the core branch</li><li>Jenkins (in this case) starts running the <em>terraform init/plan</em> commands</li><li>Jenkins alerts on the <em>terraform plan</em> implementation outcome</li><li>DevOps engineer reviews / approves it&nbsp;</li><li>Then the request is knitted into the core branch</li><li>Jenkins runs the <em>terraform apply</em> from the core branch&nbsp;</li><li>When it’s done, don’t forget to get rid of the clone branch.</li></ol>



<p>Sounds simple and quite sweet, but what if the<em> terraform apply</em> crashes? I tell you what, you end up with a shuttered branch, the core branch, actually. New pulls cannot be performed until the previous failures are tackled and the terraform apply is victoriously performed. What about velocity? Not a good picture at all. With a couple of environments administered simultaneously, sometimes the waiting time extends to 15-20 min. Taking that rerunning the pulls is a time-consuming and hard-to-track process, teams cannot sync up which leads to productivity reduction. The icing on the cake is a must to create custom code if you need to set up any credentials, download Terraform plugins, or cleanse the workspace.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What is Atlantis?</h2>



<p>Let’s start by explaining what Terraform is. First, the official definition from <a href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html">HashiCorp</a>:</p>



<p><em>Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.</em></p>



<p>In simple terms, <b>Terraform</b> empowers you with insight into how your infrastructure will be displayed on the cloud, in cooperation with any cloud provider, by the way. Due to Terraform&#8217;s simple syntax and omni-cloud congeniality, it’s our first-choice tool for IaC implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1141" height="596" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_Atlantis-updated-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8171" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_Atlantis-updated-1.jpg 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_Atlantis-updated-1-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></figure>



<p>What is Atlantis then? <b>Atlantis</b> is an open-source tool that allows you to securely collaborate on Terraform projects by verifying that recommended adjustments are addressed and that the planned modification is a current change that needs to be performed on your infrastructure. How does it work? You simply comment on the pull request and Atlantis starts operating the Terraform commands. Atlantis gets back to you on the pull request to display the <em>terraform plan</em>. With Atlantis operating the terraform apply, you can be sure your changes will be applied before the pull request joins the core branch. Basically, you can configure Atlantis to ask for approval before marrying your pull request with the core branch and automate this process at most. With Atlantis leveraging the <em>atlantis.yaml</em> file, you can avoid writing custom code.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Atlantis in force&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Let’s examine the infrastructure flow steps with Atlantis.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>As always we get to the Terraform git repo and create a new branch <em>master (core) </em>clone, make necessary modifications, commit them and drive the branch to the repo</li><li>Then we release a pull request to the core branch.</li><li>With each new pull or commit set up, Atlantis will try to operate the <em>terraform plan </em>and get back to you with the <em>terraform plan </em>outcome.</li><li>In case you want to perform a plan one more time, you just need to report on the pull with the Atlantis plan. Specific project plan requires <em>atlantis plan -p &lt;name of your project&gt; </em>formulation.&nbsp;</li><li>With pull request confirming, comment on the pull request with the <em>atlantis apply</em> or <em>atlantis apply -p &lt;name of your project&gt;</em> in a specific project case.</li><li>That’s it, Atlantis is operating the <em>terraform apply</em> now.&nbsp;</li><li>Plus, Atlantis will auto-blend your changes to the core branch, as long as your changes were carefully checked and applied.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h2>Final thoughts: Jenkins + Terraform or Atlantis + Terraform?</h2>



<p>Well, it doesn&#8217;t really matter what combination Jenkins + Terraform or Atlantis + Terraform you choose &#8212; running CI/CD Terraform pipelines is far from being easy if you try to do it on your own. Fortunately, Jenkins, Atlantis, and other brilliant automation tools came to save the day. However, if Atlantis has become your choice, here are some tips for this project to work:</p>



<ul><li>Use Atlantis to run a PoC (proof of concept). You can do it<a href="https://www.runatlantis.io/guide/testing-locally.html"> locally</a>.</li><li>Identify the low-risk parts of the infrastructure that can be managed using the Atlantis workflow.</li><li>Upskill developers performing a high-level knowledge transfer on Terraform&nbsp;</li><li>Before applying the code in a production environment, double-check that DevOps engineers’ approval is required.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>What’s good with Atlantis? It lets teams collaborate more effectively which has a definite positive effect on productivity. As for the velocity, no more time-wasting as opening a pull request, <em>terraform plan </em>and <em>terraform apply </em>takes moments. Plus, infrastructure changes can be performed in many environments simultaneously.&nbsp;One way or another, it’s up to you what Terraform automatization tool to choose. Both Jenkins and Atlantis are effective enough, but we thought it’s good for you to have options. If you have questions about IaC designing/performing or any other<a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/"> DevOps</a>-linked issue, we are here to deal with it.</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/06-2021-how-to-automate-infrastructure-with-atlantis-and-terraform/">How to Automate Infrastructure with Atlantis and Terraform</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>What if we could manage and automate policies? What if authorization could be delegated to a reliable tool and done, I repeat, automatically? Sounds good. In fact, adopting an automated code-based policy enables IT organizations to become more proactive with an emphasis on efficiency and scalability. Gartner believes that simply implementing automated compliance checks early in the DevOps process can reduce time to market by up to 20%. But the thing is that while authentication is resulting in identity, answering the question of <em>who you are</em>, authorization is more about services involved in the process explaining <em>what you can do</em>. With that in mind, experts decided to get the authorization policies closer to the services. And what can be closer than inside of the service code? That’s how the <b>Policy-as-Code (PaC)</b> notion emerged where a totally independent code, which can be easily extracted from app code and business logic, automatically tests the adherence to policies. And that’s how the challenge of finding the right PaC solution took IT center stage. Where to look for this solution and how to choose the right one will be discussed here.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What is Policy-as-Code?</h2>



<p>In the past, policies were written and implemented by security and compliance specialists in the form of text docs. With time, Graphic User Interfaces on cloud platforms were used to introduce policies. Both of these paths are fallible,&nbsp; low-speed, and tedious as done mostly manually. Obviously, these methods cannot catch up with rapidly altered and fully automated systems, slowing them down at most. If you add to this constant troubleshooting and risk-handling, you get the picture, and it’s not pretty &#8212; time, money, and energy-consuming process, which inevitably affects teams’ productivity. Solution? Experts thought, “<em>If there is an infrastructure-as-code, there must be a policy-as-code!</em>” And that’s how the long road to developing reliable and effective PaC tooling began.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Policy-in-Code? Absolutely not!&nbsp;</p>



<p>These two, policy and code coupling, however, took their toll. With policy embedded into the code, it became a true challenge to share, scale or even discuss it within or across the teams. Experienced developers could not extract this particularly policy-related code from app code and business logic. And even if they could, it would get all the time in the world wasted on this task, which is absolutely unreasonable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Policy-<b>IN-</b>Code is something you should avoid! Having organizational policy included in the code was, by all means, better than holding it in the form of PDF files, docs or dashboard tickets. However, with policy codified and mixed with the app code, we try to have both the original doc and code-implemented policy in sync, which inevitably leads to failure rate-raising when they drift apart, and they will. Have you ever experienced a situation when you cannot understand what these code comments really mean? If it’s mildly frustrating when we deal with app code, with policy powered by national and international law it might lead to disastrous consequences. So, the solution is to have a policy as a real code, but it should be autonomous, easily extracted from software code and business logic.<em> Where do we get one?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delegated authorization? Hold on! Is that legal?</p>



<p>With policy into the code inserting, an even more disturbing problem emerged &#8212; change management. Any update and change involved redeploying of each feature. With monolithic architecture software, it could be done without any complications, but with microservice-based apps, it seemed an impossible case. <em>What if we had one policy shared between hundreds/thousands of services and those services autonomously built up their own updates?&nbsp; </em>The delegated authentication model handled change management by stating that &#8220;<em>changes are operated within the identity system</em>,&#8221; and the microservices model delegated this assignment to individual teams running the service.</p>



<p>Policy-as-Code with OPA? Why not!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PaC-benefits-без-лого-fixed.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8166" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PaC-benefits-без-лого-fixed.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PaC-benefits-без-лого-fixed-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PaC-benefits-без-лого-fixed-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PaC-benefits-без-лого-fixed-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<p>The more organizations tried to find a perfect authorization solution, the harder it was to discover one. Not until the <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org">Open Policy Agent (OPA)</a> was introduced to the public. So, why is it that good? With Policy-as-Code involving high-level language to be written on, OPA’s policies are supposed to be expressed in <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/">Rego</a> (declarative language). This solved the Policy-IN-Code problem because now policy code can easily be extracted from the software code, and extraneous business logic; can easily be shared and scaled within or across the teams and divisions. So how does it work? As easy as pie. When a policy engine is pinged by the request, it takes the request input, sufficient data, policy guidance and creates a request result. Apart from OPA, organizations might use <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel">Sentinel</a> from HashiCorp, which is also a good PaC solution. </p>



<h2>Policy-as-Code benefits</h2>



<p>While PaC benefits are clearly seen by tech specialists, some organizational leaders might find PaC implementation a bit resource-consuming and overwhelming, not realizing how easily this initial investment will pay off pretty soon. So, what are the PaC benefits?</p>



<p>Pre-deployment validation</p>



<p>The problem when policies are tested only after the deployment is history now. With the right PaC solution, you can test how it works during the preview session. The policies start working even before the resources are registered and all the parameters are carefully validated. Policy-violating resources are taken away and modified. In the cases when you need to check one particular resource separately from others, this also can be done with a proper PaC tool. One way or another, the whole infrastructure is tested and validated before the deployment, which significantly saves time and cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Costs regulation&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from obvious cost savings due to pre-deployment testing and consequently reducing failure rates, PaC solutions can handle cloud spending sprawl. Overwhelming cloud costs paid for big-sized instances, and daily growing bills for unused resources, which are very difficult to detect and get rid of, is today’s digital industry’s unpretty reality. Correctly chosen, PaC tooling can also help with this problem precisely by setting policy based on pricing, and detecting/eliminating the unused resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Improved Security</p>



<p>The best practice is to control inbound/outbound traffic to/from resources and prevent them from being exposed to the Internet. Organizational policies can reduce the possibility of unauthorized access to resources or even data leaks. No matter what type of environment it is: development, test, or production, Policy as Code can ensure that best practices are adhered to throughout the organization. Another issue of concern is securing your software supply chain. Even though your infrastructure is running on a cloud provider, vulnerabilities are not excluded. For example, with <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8835">CVE-2020-8835</a> which gets containers to avoid root privileges on the core node, on Google Cloud Platform, Ubuntu nodes running Kubernetes 1.16 and 1.17 were damaged. With that, you can write a policy that audits the version of Google Kubernetes Engine and blocks their deployment.</p>



<h2>How to choose the right PaC solution</h2>



<p>Several aspects need to be considered in order to select the right policy framework. Some of these aspects include:</p>



<ul><li>How community accepted and adopted this particular solution</li><li>How complex the solution is</li><li>How this solution allies to the organization&#8217;s capabilities and strategies</li><li>How it satisfies the use cases in your enterprise</li><li>What is the support model</li><li>What is the scalability option&nbsp;</li><li>How it integrates with other (local) tools.</li></ul>



<p>With these aspects considered, each IT leader should make a decision on each aspect&#8217;s importance or weight rate for this organization and the rate of fit of these already weighted aspects. Here is an example of a transparent and quite efficient method to a data-driven opinion presented in the form of a scorecard based on data from the solution evaluation. The weights/fits rates are multiplied taking each aspect/solution combo. And these numbers are added together to obtain an overall decision score.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final thoughts: Policy-as-Code, Yes, please or No, thank you?</h2>



<p>Policy-as-Code helps incorporate codified policies into life cycles earlier and more efficiently compared to tedious and exhausting manual policies’ implementation. What’s more, PaC is applied more consistently and faster across any number of development and deployment streams, across various stages of DevOps pipelines, etc. With software raising in number and quality, with the life cycle tending to become more and more automated and streamlined, logically policies governing products should develop. PaC promotes automated testing, which is much faster, more reliable, and more effective than manual testing. With the help of PaC, organizations easily apply compliance, security, and other rules or restrictions through quick and cost-effective processes. However, if choosing the right Policy-as-Code is a bit challenging for you we, at IT Svit, are here to help you with that or with any other<a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/"> DevOps</a>-related issue.&nbsp;</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/06-2021-picking-the-right-policy-as-code-solution/">Picking the Right Policy-as-Code Solution</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><b>Bullish DevOps News/Updates May edition is here! </b>We provide a compendium of recent DevOps news, updates, recommendations, and other helpful DevOps-related content every month. This digest is created for DevOps engineers, developers, system administrators, IT operation specialists, IT leaders and other DevOps-impassioned people to be updated about the DevOps World’s latest news and useful insights. So, in the May issue: systemd service security improving, choosing a right PaC solution, the most well-known cloud platforms comparison, and many other delicious<a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/"> DevOps</a>-allied treats.</p>



<h2>How to improve systemd service security</h2>



<p>With hackers attacks increasing daily, organizations are entirely in search of ways to minimize the attack surface. One of the best methods is to resort to containerization, however, with apps developed on systemd, it could be hard. So, how to strengthen the security of systemd-based software with the help of features like sandboxing. This is discussed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alegrey91/">Alessio Greggi </a>in his <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/systemd-service-strengthening">“Systemd Service Hardening”</a> work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How to pick a proper Policy-as-Code solution</h2>



<p>While on the subject of container cluster security improvement, we’ve chosen to share these articles from Amazon on “Policy-based countermeasures for Kubernetes” <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/containers/policy-based-countermeasures-for-kubernetes-part-1/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/containers/policy-based-countermeasures-for-kubernetes-part-2/">Part 2</a>. In these issues, AWS experts stress the need for <b>policy-as-code solutions (PaC)</b> for automated security, compliance, and privacy controls to detect, reduce and, more importantly, prevent each known and unknown threat. With the right PaC solution, organizations can reuse DevOps and GitOps strategies to manage and apply the countermeasures across fleets of container clusters.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Writing-a-Kubernetes-Operator.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8161" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Writing-a-Kubernetes-Operator.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Writing-a-Kubernetes-Operator-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Writing-a-Kubernetes-Operator-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Writing-a-Kubernetes-Operator-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<h2>How to write a custom Kubernetes operator</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://anupamgogoi.medium.com/writing-a-kubernetes-operator-from-zero-to-hero-8ca5dc2462b7">“Writing a Kubernetes Operator: From Zero to Hero”</a> article, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupam-gogoi-91382317/?originalSubdomain=br">Anupam Gogoi </a>explained how to create a very simple k8s custom operator from zero using the Operator-SDK. Operators are the product extensions that utilize custom resources to operate the software and its components. More detailed information about operators you can find <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">here</a>. The author stressed that users can create any custom operator leveraging any language they like.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Template Files with HashiCorp Packer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Presently, for OS configuration just before you connect it to the VM you need to utilize the <em>boot-command </em>argument. A <em>boot_command </em>imitates manual keystrokes and sends them at a regular cadence. You aggregate these keystrokes for installing and configuring packages in a <a href="https://www.packer.io/guides/automatic-operating-system-installs/preseed_ubuntu">preseed file</a>. Packer allows sharing preseed files by making them available statically through an HTTP server. In this <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/using-template-files-with-hashicorp-packer">post</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriendelorme/?originalSubdomain=nl">Adrien Delorme</a> showed how to use the <em>http_content </em>and the <em>template</em> file functions combined to build preseed file templates for two Ubuntu images: with HashiCorp Nomad and with HashiCorp Consul.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AWS-Azure-services-are-compared-to-Google-Cloud.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8162" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AWS-Azure-services-are-compared-to-Google-Cloud.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AWS-Azure-services-are-compared-to-Google-Cloud-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AWS-Azure-services-are-compared-to-Google-Cloud-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AWS-Azure-services-are-compared-to-Google-Cloud-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<h2>GCP / AWS / Azure services comparing</h2>



<p>Pretty often cloud-platform users face the problem of service abundance and get confused with all the product names, definitions, prices, etc. which leads to unreasonable waste of resources. With that, Google presented a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/aws-azure-gcp-service-comparison">table</a> that listed generally available Google Cloud services and traced them to similar offerings in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Additionally, users can filter the list with keywords like service type, capability, or product name. Plus, you can estimate and compare costs <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/estimate-costs-google-cloud-platform">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dealing with custom resource definition service</h2>



<p>If you want to introduce your own extensions (a.k.a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#api-server-aggregation">custom resources</a>) into the Kubernetes cluster, getting acquainted with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/">a custom resource definition (CRD)</a> file is a must. CRD defines your own object kinds and lets the API Server handle the entire lifecycle. This frees you from writing your API server to deal with the custom resource. Here is a comfortable, open-source <a href="https://doc.crds.dev">service</a> to create CRDs presented by GitHub pro bono.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How to run Ceph on k8s with Rook top practices</h2>



<p>Ceph and Kubernetes are sophisticated tools that harmonize interactions between the two. This is especially true for users who are new to any of these systems. The questions they ask are as follows: <em>How can I restrict Ceph to a fraction of my nodes? Can I set Kubernetes CPU or RAM limits for my Ceph daemons? How can I improve the performance of my cluster? </em>This <a href="https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all/pdf/SBP-rook-ceph-kubernetes_color_en.pdf">document</a>, presented by <a href="https://www.suse.com">SUSE</a> experts, describes proven patterns and best practices to answer these and other questions. The examples and tips based on Ceph Octopus (v15) with Rook v1.3 running on a Kubernetes 1.17 cluster will help you configure and manage your Ceph cluster running on k8s to meet your needs.</p>



<h2>Kubernetes SSO &#8211; detailed guide</h2>



<p>In his “<a href="http://www.talkingquickly.co.uk/kubernetes-sso-a-detailed-guide">Kubernetes Single Sign-on (SSO)</a>” guide <a href="https://twitter.com/talkingquickly">Ben Dixon</a> showed how to set up an end-to-end group SSO for Kubernetes, including <em>kubectl </em>CLI, any web ingress-kind app, docker registry, and Gitea. He covered most of the common SSO models, for them to be easily adapted to other tools like Gitlab, Kibana, Grafana, etc. The complete solution uses Keycloak supported by OpenLDAP. OpenLDAP is required for the Gitea component but can be skipped for other components, including OIDC-based SSO for kubectl.</p>

<p>Many see DevOps as a set of practices to streamline and automate the software development processes to cut costs and shorten time-to-market. Yes, DevOps is about these improvements, but its underlying purpose is to boost the business’s worth for the customers. This main goal can only be reached by teams&#8217; effective collaboration. This means every organization needs a particular team structure to secure teams’ productivity and powerful cooperation. Today we will discuss <b>team topologies</b> as an explicit and easy-to-implement approach to software delivery focusing on optimizing team interactions for the smoothest flow.</p>



<h2>DevOps Team Patterns&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DevOps-topology-patterns2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8158" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DevOps-topology-patterns2.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DevOps-topology-patterns2-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DevOps-topology-patterns2-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DevOps-topology-patterns2-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<p>What team shape is good for DevOps to thrive? There is no magic, fit-all combination, however, it wouldn’t hurt if we described a couple of quite compelling types of team structures presented by software experts and counselors <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/people">Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais</a>. With strong and weak points of these structures/topologies explored, IT leaders can identify which team organization might work best for their organization, considering <b>Conway’s Law</b>: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations</em>.” </p></blockquote>



<p><b>Tеam Pattern № 1: Dev and Ops Collaboration</b></p>



<p>The smoothest collaboration between Dev teams and IT Ops teams happens when each team is focusing on their assignments and interacting when and where needed. Clearly, this pattern requires quite a significant organizational switch to implement it properly. Dev and IT Ops should share a plainly disclosed and verifiably valid goal. Taking that Ops guys must feel cozy dealing with test-driven code writing and Devs must get serious about operational input and involve Ops specialists into logging operations, etc. &#8212; quite a severe change is required here, mostly cultural.&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Team Pattern № 2: </b><b>Ops as Infrastructure-as-a-Service</b></p>



<p>IT businesses with classic IT Operations teams cannot perform cultural shifts quickly enough. With that, these organizations might treat the IT Ops as an Infrastructure-as-a-code provider, especially if we talk about running-on-public-cloud organization type. A DevOps team, in this case, functions as an operational quality (server provisioning, monitoring, troubleshooting, etc.) expert. It’s still a Dev team, plus specific practices like test-driven coding, CI, recurrent development, instructing, and others. Pattern № 2 clearly demonstrates some potential for easier enforcement especially compared to Topology Pattern № 1, which, by the way, can be implemented afterward.&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Team Pattern № 3: </b><b>&nbsp;DevOps Team with an Expiry Date</b></p>



<p>The DevOps Team with an Expiry Date performs as a separate team in its individual silo, but it has a transitory duty to improve collaboration between Devs and IT Ops and eventually vanish when the mission is complete. The members of the DevOps team with an expiry date will ‘mediate’ between Devs and Ops, introducing novelties like Kanban/Scrum for Ops teams, and dealing with details like network interface card operation, load-balancers, and so on for the developers. With that, it’s rather important not to give everlasting CI/CD responsibilities to the provisional team, otherwise, it will become a separate DevOps team, which is a team structure antipattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Team Pattern № 4: </b><b>DevOps as an External Service</b></p>



<p>Many IT organizations, especially SMBs and startups have small budgets and tough deadlines to build an in-house DevOps team or wait until the cultural reincarnation happens. More importantly, they lack experienced specialists skilled enough to provide professional operational maneuvers for the SDLC. In this case, IT leaders turn to a <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps services</a> provider to help them design and implement cost-effective and high-performing infrastructures, automate and optimize their existing environments, and give recommendations on all kinds of operational matters and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conway’s law or why teams go first&nbsp;</h2>



<p>According to <b>Conway&#8217;s law</b>, the teams’ configuration and the way they communicate within the organization can sustain the resulting growth. Teams ought to go FIRST! There are different angles to consider: team size, team life-expectancy, team connections, and others. Hierarchical groupings should follow <b>Dunbar&#8217;s number</b>, starting with 5-8 individuals, at the appropriate time expanding to around 15 individuals, then to 50 / 150 / 500, etc. <b>Cognitive load</b> <b>(CL) </b>stipulates, “<em>The total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory</em>.” It means you should restrict group obligations to coordinate with the most extreme group intellectual load. The accompanying three types of cognitive load are explained:</p>



<ul><li>Intrinsic CL – identifies with the task parts major to the issue</li><li>Extraneous CL&nbsp; – identifies with the climate wherein the assignment is performed</li><li>Germane CL – identifies with task parts that need exceptional consideration.</li></ul>



<p>So, basically, cognitive load is a kind of limiting factor for the team’s operation and performance. Teams need to be sized and engineered so they could cope with assignments never reaching cognitive overwhelm.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>4 Fundamental Team Topologies</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Four-fundamental-topologies.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8159" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Four-fundamental-topologies.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Four-fundamental-topologies-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Four-fundamental-topologies-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Four-fundamental-topologies-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<p>The<b> Team Topologies </b>approach, also designed and presented by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais described in their <em>“</em><a href="https://teamtopologies.com"><em>Team Topologies: organizing business and technology teams for fast flow</em></a>” book, underlines the importance of <b>teams</b> for high-quality product delivery. Skeleton and Pais claim that the software development team should grow to the place where <b>trust </b>teams up with a <b>high-performance</b> <b>boost</b>. Here are 4 underlying team topologies that are expected to accommodate the high-geared capabilities at most.&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Stream-Aligned Team</b></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“A ‘stream’ is the continuous flow of work aligned to a business domain or organizational capability. The continuous flow requires clarity of purpose and responsibility so that multiple teams can coexist, each with their own flow of work.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>It is a team lined up with the standard of business change, with a bunch of cross-practical skills. They are allowed to convey huge additions without wasting time waiting for another team to approve any of their steps. This team is obligated to convey product worth to customers as quickly as possible.</p>



<p><b>Platform team</b></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>The purpose of a platform team is to enable stream-aligned teams to deliver work with substantial autonomy.</em>”</p></blockquote>



<p>A stage/platform team is a team that runs on a base stage, keeping stream-aligned team flows in conveyance. The principal task for the stage team is to work on complex platform innovations and scale down tension and, consequently, the CL in the groups that utilize it.</p>



<p><b>Enabling team</b></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“An enabling team is composed of specialists in a given technical (or product) domain, and they help bridge this capability gap.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Enabling team is a team that helps other teams in improving software quality as part of an evolution or learning period. With this team avoiding delivery pressure, they can easily focus on product improvement and the capabilities required to upgrade innovation. So, basically, enabling team bonds with a stream-aligned team to research, try out some new trends, share info about innovative tooling, frameworks, etc. Their interaction style has mostly the recommendatory nature of counseling and support.</p>



<p><b>Complicated-Subsystem Team</b></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>A complicated-subsystem team is responsible for building and maintaining a part of the system that depends heavily on specialist knowledge, to the extent that most team members must be specialists in that area of knowledge in order to understand and make changes to the sub-system.</em>”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is a team with special permissions for a subsystem that is too complex to be handled by a stream-aligned or platform team. Complicated-subsystem team existence is optional and only used when needed.</p>



<h2>Team interaction modes</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Team-interaction-modes.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8156" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Team-interaction-modes.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Team-interaction-modes-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Team-interaction-modes-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Team-interaction-modes-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<p>Team interaction should also be orchestrated well. Skelton and Pais identify three types of team interaction modes:</p>



<ul><li>Collaboration: uniting forces and closely working on the same/related assignments</li><li>X-as-a-Service: Consuming or providing something (service) with minimal cooperation</li><li>Facilitating: dealing with obstacles and helping other teams to overcome them.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>With these models on the table, we can clearly see that <b>DevOps Team Pattern № 1</b> can be implemented through collaboration between a Stream-aligned team and a Platform team. Platform team implements <b>DevOps Team Pattern № 2 </b>(Ops-as-a-service) and <b>Team Pattern № 3</b> (DevOps Team with an Expiry Date) is something that a Complicated-Subsystem Team does when assisting with complex tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wrapping things up</h2>



<p>The team topologies approach does not perform any magic. Each organization should consider team topologies’ disadvantages, which are how to share expertise between stream-aligned teams, how to build the platform team for it not to transform into another silo, how to ensure security, and the other weak points, before trying to implement these structures. If you lack experience, time, or skilled teams to deal with these rather complex challenges, you can always resort to <b>Team Pattern № 4:</b> DevOps as an External Service and turn to mature <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps outsourcing companies</a> for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/05-2021-how-to-implement-devops-via-team-topologies-approach/">How to Implement DevOps via Team Topologies Approach</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Although the Pipeline-as-a-code technique is commonly enforced by the bulk of CI/CD platforms, GitHub Actions might take this service to the next level with its Pipeline-as-a-Code Building Blocks model. Why open-source Pipeline-as-a-Code Building Blocks is more than just another CI/CD tool and how GitHub Actions embarked on a new wave in CI/CD evolution will be discussed in this article.</p>



<h2>How GitHub Actions help automate SDLC</h2>



<p>If your desire to create an offbeat workflow in your GitHub repository seems a bit challenging, Github Actions is the perfect platform to implement this daring project. You simply create workflows of tasks aka <em>actions</em> that are automatically operated on particular <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks#events">events</a>. That is how you easily incorporate continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery/deployment (CD), and lots of other valuable life cycle rounds into your repository. What benefits GitHub Actions furnish:</p>



<ul><li><b>GitHub insider.</b> You do not need any outer site to deal with GitHub Actions because it’s totally mingled with GitHub which means you do not need to change the place to operate your brand-new flows.</li><li><b>Myriad-container setup &amp; testing. </b>You just need to add Docker-compose files to your new flow for actions to set up and test numerous containers simultaneously.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Abundant CI patterns.</b> Here you can find lots of CI samples of all kinds and composition models with the possibility to design your own custom template of course. By the way, your templates can be published as a new Action on the Github Marketplace.</li><li><b>Any-server-friendly.</b> After you create your flows either by composing blocks/steps in the visual editor or writing them yourself using YAM, you can use GitHub’s, another provider’s or your self-hosted server to run them.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Real-time logging+continuous monitoring. </b>You can<b> </b>watch your workflow live running spiced up with color and emoji. And just in one click, you copy a link that highlights a specific CI/CD failure to share it immediately with the team.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Any-OS-friendly.</b> Whatever OS you have: Linux, macOS, or Windows, GitHub Actions work with it. You can operate in a container or virtual machine, utilize your own virtual machine on cloud or on-prem &#8212; everything will work with Actions.</li><li><b>Any-language-friendly. </b>GitHub Actions works with any programming language (Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, etc.) you choose for your product.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Easy-share/scale/update</b>. Being stored in a repository, it is easy to share and scale flows within or across projects.</li><li><b>Community-supported workflows</b>. GitHub Actions bring together all of your tools to automate every phase of your SDLC. You do not need to reinvent a wheel; you just leverage the vast number of open libraries accessible on GitHub to develop your tasks for your custom flows.&nbsp;</li><li><b>It’s free! </b>Actions present 2000 charge-less build minutes a month for all your private repositories which puts GitHub in the vanguard compared to most CI/CD platforms.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2>How Pipeline-as-a-code Building Blocks popped up or three stages of CI/CD evolution</h2>



<p>With DevOps, businesses focusing on streamlining and automating software development processes at most, they are eternally in search of best CI/CD tooling. How CI/CD platforms evolved? In our humble opinion, three distinct steps or stages of CI/CD development can be named. Let’s trace them down:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1 stage &#8212;<b> Jenkins at your service!&nbsp;</b></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“I was busy implementing the JAXB RI, I must have broken one too many builds… Wouldn’t it be nice if I can have a program to make sure that the workspace is always built?”</em></p><p>Kohsuke Kawaguchi,&nbsp;staff Engineer at Sun Microsystems, creator of Jenkins</p></blockquote>



<p>Back in 2007 Hudson (<a href="https://www.jenkins.io">Jenkins)</a> took over <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net">Cruise Control</a> and other open-source build-servers and proved to be the top automation server for all phases of SDLC promoting CI/CD. At the JavaOne conference in May 2008, the service even earned the Duke&#8217;s Choice Award in the Developer Solutions tier. After a brawl with Oracle, in 2011, Hudson was retitled to Jenkins. Jenkins was and undoubtedly is a premium CI/CD platform and certainly distinguishes the first step of CI/CD expansion, which is CI/CD adoption (only before <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin">the Jenkins Job DSL plugin</a> turned up)&nbsp;</p>



<p>2 stage &#8212;<b> Pipeline-as-a-code? Be my guest!</b> With the Job DSL plugin, the first stage of CI/CD growth was over. The Job DSL plugin &#8212; and later the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2016/02/29/jenkins2-alphas/">Jenkins 2.0 pipeline project</a> in 2016 &#8212; can be considered the second stage of CI/CD platforms development. Why? Well, Jenkins is an excellent tool for operating builds, but specialists tend to utilize UI to configure jobs. Jobs, when growing in number, make maintaining them impossibly laborious and exhausting. What’s more, the solution of job duplication failed as these &#8220;clones&#8221; differentiated from their masters and therefore it became harder to sustain their coherence. The Job DSL plugin tackled this issue by enabling jobs to be described in a programmed form, in a human-coherent file. But, as for me, Jenkins actually was not the following CI/CD phases’ kinetic energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a>, released in 2013, aiming at providing free CI/CD services for open source projects has made a gigantic step towards pushing the next evolution round forward. How exactly? With Travis CI and GitHub’s marriage, the emerging system can be seen as a precursor to current software development techniques, when engineers are responsible for writing a couple of lines of code, composing pipelines, and building an application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com">GitLab CI</a> fetched the IT industry the capacity and efficiency of CI/CD pipelines that we only got from Travis CI. GitLab CI also solved the problem that we faced with most of the Pipeline-as-Code platforms. Released in version 11.7 in early 2019, GitLab CI has made one giant leap by injecting the <em>include</em> keyword into their pipeline syntax. With that, reusable pipeline patterns were translated into reality. Jenkins also made it possible with their pipelines, however, some experts find these solutions a bit unrefined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Atlassian <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo">Bamboo</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">Bitbucket Pipelines</a>, correspondingly on-premises and SaaS CI/CD tooling versions are good for users favouring self-hosted solutions. The problem is that the Bamboo/Bitbucket fee might be a little too much especially for SMB and startups. Indeed, there is no one-size-fits-all tool. Still, a period when Pipeline-as-a-Code stepped on a scene and CI/CD platforms picked up the trend can be acknowledged as the second stage of CI/CD evolution.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Opensource-PipelineasCode-Building-Blocks-or-its-all-about-the-Actions.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8127" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Opensource-PipelineasCode-Building-Blocks-or-its-all-about-the-Actions.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Opensource-PipelineasCode-Building-Blocks-or-its-all-about-the-Actions-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Opensource-PipelineasCode-Building-Blocks-or-its-all-about-the-Actions-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Opensource-PipelineasCode-Building-Blocks-or-its-all-about-the-Actions-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<p>3 stage &#8212; <b>Lights, camera, action! </b>In late 2019, GitHub revealed the accessibility of GitHub Actions. “<em>Who cares? It’s just one more CI/CD tool,</em>“ everyone thought and was wrong. Well, yes, it’s definitely one of the outstanding CI/CD platforms, but one element was added that segregates it from the others. And it&#8217;s straight in the title: Action! Just take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">GitHub Actions Marketplace</a>. All the actions here are provided not only by GitHub but also by other companies in the community. One way or another they are here absolutely available on GitHub. Assembling like well-known Lego building blocks, these actions tackle common, rather painful issues from how we are supposed to reuse what we have written here to how we deploy our application to this new cloud service using Infrastructure-as-Code when writing CI/CD pipelines. These and many other features are already covered by accessible GitHub Actions. What’s more, if you want your code lines to be drastically reduced in number &#8212; turn to GitHub Actions. With each Action version number attached, you do not need to have a headache that your pipelines will be spontaneously altered. The upgrades are clear-cut and fully automated. Additionally, if by extraordinary coincidence, you cannot find an action you need, you can always write and publish one.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Final thoughts&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To wrap things up, we think that GitHub Actions start a new level in CI/CD platforms expansion. With Actions, we can cut our gigantic code in half and we don&#8217;t need to support in-house teams to write reusable templates. We just find the already published action and use it. Surely, GitHub will not be the only company adopting the Pipeline-as-a-Code Building model, however, so far only GitHub widely enforces it. Try GitHub Actions for your next project. If you find it challenging and have any action/<a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps</a>-related questions you can always turn to us and we will consult you on any issue you have.&nbsp;</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/05-2021-github-actions-pipeline-as-a-code-building-rising/">GitHub Actions: Pipeline-as-a-Code Building Blocks Rising</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Probably you’ve already become a huge fan of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/bullish-devops-news-updates-april-2021/"><b>Bullish DevOps news/updates monthly issues</b></a> where we follow all fresh DevOps headlines including the latest tools, methodologies, guides, tips, and recommendations to deal with tough DevOps projects. Today, we’ve prepared something new: a compilation of <b>challenges</b> our customers faced and how we came up with sophisticated <b>solutions</b>. So, in today’s <b>Tips from IT Svit </b>release: how to <b>install and configure a scalable cluster logging system</b> capable of collecting and studying logs for a certain period; how to <b>install and configure the Zimbra mail server in GCP</b>, how to <b>combine remote networks into one broadcast network</b> with MikroTik at the input and other goodies. Let’s delve into reading!&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Scalable cluster logging system installation and configuration&nbsp;</h2>



<p><b>Challenge</b>&nbsp; &#8212; It was necessary to provide developers with an intuitive system for monitoring the cluster resources and the cluster itself.</p>



<p><b>Solution </b>&#8212;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 1 &#8211; Analysis. We analyzed existing open-source logging systems <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/elk-vs-loki-how-to-gather-logs-from-kubernetes-cluster-and-effectively-navigate-through-them/">ELK stack and Loki</a></p>



<p>ELK pros:</p>



<ul><li>Uses query DSL and Lucene query language, which provide full-text search capabilities</li><li>Includes Logstash and GROK tools for generating metrics from string logs</li><li>Horizontally scalable</li><li>Transfers logs and backs-up to S3 (google storage)</li><li>Has lots of supplementary modules.</li></ul>



<p>ELK cons:</p>



<ul><li>May require a sufficient amount of storage space</li><li>When installing a cluster solution and plenty of information, ELK is a rather resource-intensive solution.</li></ul>



<p>Loki pros:</p>



<ul><li>Horizontally scalable</li><li>Transfers logs and backs-up to S3 (google storage)</li><li>Less resource-intensive than ELK.</li></ul>



<p>Loki cons:</p>



<ul><li>Displaying and filtering over 10,000 rows takes a long time in Grafana</li><li>Filtering logs and converting metrics regular expressions.</li></ul>



<p>Step 2 &#8212; Installation. Our choice fell on ELK. Here is the installation process.</p>



<p>Add the Elastic Helm charts repo:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co</code></pre>



<p>Elastic</p>



<p>with Helm 3: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm install elasticsearch --version &lt;version&gt; elastic/elasticsearch
</code></pre>



<p>wih Helm 2 (deprecated):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm install --name elasticsearch --version &lt;version&gt; elastic/elasticsearch</code></pre>



<p>Logstash</p>



<p>with Helm 3:<code> </code></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm install logstash --version &lt;version&gt; elastic/logstash</code></pre>



<p>with Helm 2 (deprecated):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm install --name logstash --version &lt;version&gt;` elastic/logstash
</code></pre>



<p>Filebeat</p>



<p>with Helm 3: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm install filebeat --version &lt;version&gt; elastic/filebeat
</code></pre>



<p>with Helm 2 (deprecated): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm install --name filebeat --version &lt;version&gt; elastic/filebeat
</code></pre>



<p>Kibana</p>



<p>with Helm 3: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm install kibana --version &lt;version&gt; elastic/kibana
</code></pre>



<p>with Helm 2 (deprecated): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm install --name kibana --version &lt;version&gt; elastic/kibana
</code></pre>



<p><b>Results</b> &#8212; The ELK stack can be used for a variety of purposes, providing the maximum flexibility and feature-rich Kibana interface for analytics, visualization, and queries. As a result, developers get an intuitive system for monitoring cluster resources and the cluster itself.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Zimbra.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8114" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Zimbra.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Zimbra-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Zimbra-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Zimbra-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<h2>Zimbra mail server in GCP installation and configuration&nbsp;</h2>



<p><b>Challenge</b> &#8212; It was required to install and configure the<a href="https://www.zimbra.com"> Zimbra mail server</a> in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Platform</a>. Zimbra mail server uses port 25 in SMTP to send mail. And the problem is that by default in GCP the Compute Engine service allows outgoing connections on all ports except port 25, which is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/sending-mail">blocked</a> due to the risk of abuse. All other ports are open, including TLS ports 587 and 465. This means the Zimbra mail server receives mail, but cannot send it.</p>



<p><b>Solution</b> &#8212;</p>



<p>Step 1 &#8212; SMTP Relay installation. The service SendGrid from Azure was used as an SMTP Relay meaning generating API KEY for configuring SMTP Relay and performing domain authentication. Configuration details <a href="https://www.e-apostolidis.gr/microsoft/azure-free-smtp-relay-using-sendgrid/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 2 &#8212; Relay host configuration. The relay host has been configured on the Zimbra mail server using the SendGrid SMTP server.</p>



<p><b>Results</b> &#8212; The mail provider blocking from the newly installed and configured Zimbra mail server was bypassed. Plus, the mail is encrypted. The SendGrid service is widely used, and therefore trusted, which increases the chance the mail will not be Spam marked.</p>



<h2>Restricting access to IAM for modules in EKS</h2>



<p><b>Challenge</b> &#8212; We were required to provide our customer with a tool that would restrict access to IAM for apps in the cluster, thereby solving our customer’s main security issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Solution</b> &#8212;</p>



<p>Step 1 &#8211; Analysis.&nbsp; We studied existing open-source tools that control IAM access for modules <a href="https://github.com/uswitch/kiam">kiam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam">kube2iam</a>.</p>



<p>Kiam pros:</p>



<ul><li>Its architecture significantly restricts access to IAM, which makes it a reliable security solution.</li><li>It was designed from the outset with specific security concerns in mind, which means that fewer nodes will be able to take on IAM roles.</li><li>An additional feature restricts access to the EC2 metadata API.</li></ul>



<p>Kiam con is that the kiam setting takes significantly longer for a production environment due to TLS and forced namespace configuration.</p>



<p>Kube2iam pro is that it has a simpler architecture that takes much less time to go into production. Kube2iam con is a weaker security solution than Kiam.</p>



<p>Step 2 &#8212; Installation. Our choice fell on kiam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kiam setup:</p>



<ol><li>Create roles that your pods will take on.</li><li>Add permission only for the nodes on which the server will run (usually master nodes) so that they can perform these roles.</li><li>Annotate pods with iam.amazonaws.com/role: &lt;role name&gt; and apply changes</li><li>Annotate the namespaces to allow acceptance of the role in each namespace with iam.amazonaws.com/permitted: &#8220;. *&#8221;. This step is required and is helpful in multi-user clusters and uses regex matching for role names.</li><li>Configure <a href="https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/blob/master/docs/TLS.md">TLS</a> for agent-server communication. This step ensures that only agents can contact the server to obtain credentials.</li><li>Create RBAC server resources.</li><li>Expand the DaemonSet server.</li><li>Deploy the DaemonSet agent.</li><li>Clear the previous IAM access method as soon as you confirm access via kiam.</li></ol>



<p><b>Results </b>&#8212; The kiam architecture limits IAM access even more than kube2iam does as it was designed with specific security concerns in mind. Fewer nodes will be able to take on IAM roles. Requiring namespace constraints is good practice even if you don&#8217;t have a multi-user cluster. The ability to restrict the metadata API is a nice bonus you get when dealing with kiam.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Broadcast_.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8115" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Broadcast_.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Broadcast_-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Broadcast_-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITSVIT_Broadcast_-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<h2>Combining remote networks into one broadcast network&nbsp;</h2>



<p><b>Challenge</b> &#8212; With Covid-19 irretrievably changing our world, unexpectedly businesses had to transform their work models to remote/hybrid forms. What if you need your teams&nbsp;to work in one broadcast network from their home-offices? For example, we have 3 geographically distant apartments. Each of them is connected to a different ISP, and MikroTik is at the entrance. OpenVPN tunnels are set up with a central server for unification, routes to subnets are registered. As a result, a person from apartment A can connect to the server in apartment B, however, DLNA traffic is visible only within one apartment and does not apply to the entire network.</p>



<p><b>Solution</b> &#8212;</p>



<p>Step 1 &#8212; Analysis. The obvious solution to the problem is to combine apartments into one broadcast network! We can do this using L2 tunnels. Given that everywhere we have MikroTik at the entrance, we can configure EoIP (Ethernet over IP) or OpenVPN tunnels. In our case, each router has a real IP address, so the choice fell on EoIP, as it is easier to configure.</p>



<p>Step 2 &#8212; Implementation.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Create EoIP tunnels between routers.</li><li>Add them to local breeches, specify any but the same horizon to avoid loops.</li><li>Change the netmask on the bridge from / 24 to / 22 (or another, if necessary).</li><li>We also issue a netmask / 22 to customers via DHCP.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Step 3 &#8212; Dealing with complications. The broadcast is live! But now another problem has appeared &#8211; there are now 3 DHCPs in our network and the user can obtain an IP address from any of them and, accordingly, access the Internet through the tunnel, not through his/her provider. Bridged traffic does not pass the IP firewall, because of L2, which would seem to exacerbate the problem. This can be solved by placing a filter in the bridge, on ports 67-68. We add restrictions that do not allow DHCP requests (and responses) to go to the tunnels and this problem is solved.</p>



<p><b>Results</b> &#8212; We have one broadcast network. Users communicate with each other (allegedly) directly, even a network printer in one apartment is visible to another apartment as a local device, and DLNA broadcasting passes without any problems.</p>



<p><b>Warning: Never do so for office networks. For security reasons!&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The most popular term-abbreviations “SRE” and “DevOps&#8221; continue having ripple effects on many experts’ minds evolving numerous polemics. Although site reliability engineering (SRE) was mentioned for the first time in 2003 and heavily used by gigantic IT influencers like Google, Netflix, Amazon, Dropbox, Alibaba, Meituan and Tencent, it’s often considered a brand-new, if not an unexplored approach. Not to mention the fact that many do not see a clear difference between SRE and DevOps. As such, we decided to sort out all the junk and discuss SRE: what it means, its origin, main principles, best practices, the difference between SRE and DevOps, and what SRE engineers do. What’s more, we will uncover SRE’s 2021 situation and plans for the future.</p>



<h2>Who invented SRE and why&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In 2003, Benjamin Treynor Sloss, a programmer at Google who invented and coined the term “SRE”, was placed responsible for running a creative group of seven engineers. The motivation behind this group was to ensure that Google websites were accessible, solid, and as failure-proof, as expected. Since Benjamin was a developer himself, he designed and organized the work of his group the way that engineers spent 50% of their time dealing with operation assignments, usually manually. Benjamin wanted them to experience how their products perform in production. Later Treynor explained that a major bottleneck in SDLC (software development lifecycle) was that development and IT operations teams had different goals and fulfilled different assignments in isolation while working on one and the same product. The development team, basically, works to set up new features taking into consideration how customers adopt them. And, to the contrary, IT operation specialists mainly focus on and guarantee service reliability.  Since each team had separate objectives, it was rather hard, if not impossible, to get business goals fully accomplished. Treynor changed that when he had bridged the gap between software development engineers and system administrators by administering developers’ attitudes into the operations field. </p>

<h2>SRE is … when dev is all about system’s reliability&nbsp;</h2>



<p>SRE is an approach that highlights aspects of the software development process and attributes them to operations matters aiming at the creation and maintenance of an extremely reliable software system. Although Google originally created SRE, Netflix has taken SRE higher than ever in respect of practice, as only with the help of 10 SRE specialists they easily perform operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) for services with thousands of microservice instances in about 200 countries all over the world. Other recognizable brands such as Amazon, Reddit, Alibaba, Meituan and Tencent eagerly endorsed this successful approach and set up SRE teams. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean that only cloud-based and SaaS companies have adopted SRE. Still, other companies: on-premises, cloud-planted, and hybrid are progressively embracing this new capacity for their software production teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Principles of SRE</p>



<ul><li>The main principle of SRE is that software development approaches can and should be applied when resolving operational issues in prod.</li><li>One more important SRE principle is to set up a service level objective (SLO) which is composed of service level indicators (SLIs) for each service in form of a service level agreement (SLA) just to track and measure your performance.</li><li>And finally, the principle of “<em>error budget</em>.” SRE engineers/managers verify the code quality and set SLOs to calculate the performance of app changes. Also, they distinguish a threshold for tolerable downtime (error budget). If downtime is within the error budget, leaders approve it. If not, the changes have to be undone and improved for them to fit into the error budget limits. You can calculate the error budget <a href="https://availability.sre.xyz">here</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Wait a minute! Is SRE DevOps and DevOps is SRE?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>18 years ago Google guys distinguished one major stopper in the software production cycle &#8211; two key teams working on one product pushing things in opposite directions. The developers aimed at creating new features and driving them to production environments as often as possible while the IT operation specialists were focused on keeping production stable and reliable. If we add diverse backgrounds and skill kits to this, you get the picture &#8212; slow, inefficient process and constant finger-pointing in case of an issue. With the problem detected, Google decided to change production administrative methods by creating a team of system administrators with a development background and mindsets; these guys were called SREs (site reliability engineers). SREs are focused on maintaining the balance between pushing new features to the production environment and keeping its stability and reliability. So, now let me ask you this:&nbsp; How can SRE be DevOps and DevOps SRE? Yes, both of these methodologies are here to eliminate the bottleneck in the software development and delivery processes. However, DevOps is mostly about streamlining, optimization and automation SDLC by improving collaboration between teams and utilizing particular practices and tools. <b>DevOps is not about developers working as system administrators, not at all, everyone keeps their roles.</b> DevOps is more about rolling out new features as often as possible with the help of properly automated CI/CD pipelines than instilling resilience of new updates for them not to harm production reliability and availability. As you can see, SRE and DevOps are different, although some experts disagree with that statement. One way or another, the main point here is that DevOps and SRE being different doesn’t mean they cannot complement each other or be used separately in various situations within one organization.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SRE engineers &#8211; Who are they and what they do?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While IT operation specialists focus on running an infrastructure they’re given by developers and troubleshooting every incident, and DevOps engineers focused on automating different Ops aspects to cut the number of failures, SREs are centered on planning, designing and updating an initially resilient infrastructure.</p>



<p>The main job responsibilities of SREs are:</p>



<ul><li>Collect specifications from partners alongside BAs and PMs&nbsp;</li><li>Plan significant level design of the infrastructure including means and flows</li><li>Conduct a top-to-bottom investigation of risk capacity&nbsp;</li><li>Calculate the possible expense of blackouts and arrange for contingencies&nbsp;</li><li>Monitor and inspect the infrastructures in prod</li><li>Prepare reports on infrastructure/flow/tools etc. updates for the team</li><li>Work with teams and teach them to adhere to certain regulation to cut the bulk of failures down</li></ul>



<p>This list might be much bigger and depends determinately on your organization’s peculiarities. By the way, Google experts have prepared not one but two books devoted to SRE and site reliability engineers’ roles and responsibilities, which you can find <a href="https://sre.google/books/">here</a> for free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>5 top predictions for SRE</h2>



<p>Without any delay,<br><b>Prediction № 1</b> &#8212; a massive hiring wave for SREs is coming. It started actually in 2019-20 but will definitely go on in 2021 and beyond as according to LinkedIn, the demand for SREs has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-emerging-jobs-in-high-demand-in-2020-2019-12#6-customer-success-specialists-have-seen-34-annual-growth-in-demand-in-the-past-five-years-10">already seen 34% growth</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Prediction № 2</b>, ironclad logic, adoption of SRE will only continue to grow. As with any adoption and implementation of something new, it should be thoroughly studied and planned. There is no all-fits-everyone solution so each organization’s leaders have two options: either go through piles of information and spend hours/days/weeks (we can continue) on planning and hiring SREs or turn to outsourcing companies that provide <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/sre-services/">SRE services</a>. The second option is one of the best choices for SMBs or startups which experience a significant lack of skilled professionals and time for that matter. One way or another, it will not hurt to consult with experienced SRE providers to answer your burning questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Prediction № 3</b> &#8212; practice and cultural shift will be prioritized in 2021 and beyond. And this means that SRE and DevOps will have to unite their forces.&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Prediction № 4</b> warns us that more people (not only SREs) will focus on the reliability of infrastructure, which means that the reliability and availability mindset will enter all the phases of SDLC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally, <b>prediction № 5</b> tells us that <em>SLIs</em>, <em>SLOs</em>, and <em>error budget </em>policies will become routine procedures. If SRE history could be described by ages like in Björn Rabenstein’s “<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/presentation/rabenstein">SRE in the Third Age</a>” theory, SRE will soon enter the third age where we will not require reliability engineers. We will require SRE as a general rule for any SDLC!</p>



<h2>Final thoughts: Do we need SRE?</h2>



<p>To wrap things up, we would like to list top SRE benefits for the business. SRE helps to:</p>



<ul><li>Accomplish, meet and often exceed customers’ expectations on the functionality and not only&nbsp;</li><li>Increase the reliability and availability of the systems</li><li>Reduce failure rates and downtime</li><li>Prevent bugs/errors and quickly reboot the systems, if anything</li><li>Reach production goals quickly and more efficiently</li><li>Automate processes for reliability to save time for teams</li><li>Increase guarantee levels</li><li>Prevent conflicts that might arise.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Whether you need SRE or not is up to you, but to answer this question you, at least, should know what you are dealing with.
