<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 has put many industries on hold for quarantine and forced many companies to reassess the way they work and interact with their customers. Working remotely and interacting with customers online quickly becomes the mainstream for all businesses and organizations that can function that way. However, working under the Waterfall project management model no longer suffices, as you have to adapt quickly to rapidly changing customer preferences.</p>



<p>DevOps workflows provide the needed functionality, but <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps</a>, as an approach to software delivery and cloud infrastructure management, is a double-edged sword. DevOps methods allow configuring and managing cloud resources at scale with ease — but a chance of misconfiguration and mishandling your data and system is greatly increased. This is why infrastructure security audit is one of the most frequent requests IT Svit has to deal with — and we have compiled pretty thorough expertise in all aspects of enabling DevOps security with AWS, GCP and other infrastructures.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1141" height="595" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ItSvit_DevOps-sec-skills_conclusion_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7617" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ItSvit_DevOps-sec-skills_conclusion_2.png 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ItSvit_DevOps-sec-skills_conclusion_2-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></figure>



<p>Below are IT Svit DevOps security skills and tasks we apply them to:</p>



<ul><li><b>Static code analysis</b>. Our engineers use SonarQube, PEP (Python), and PSR (PHP) for the early discovery of bugs and vulnerabilities and following the code design best practices.</li><li><b>Multi-Factor Authentication</b>. We use Pritunl VPN for configuring secure and personalized infrastructure access.</li><li><b>Firewall configuration</b>. We have ample experience in using IP tables, various Cisco, Mikrotik, and PfSense tools for setting up explicit access to internet-facing components, filtering, routing and port forwarding.</li><li><b>Cluster firewall</b>. We are well-versed in configuring Kubernetes cluster network policies for enabling granular network access restriction.</li><li><b>AWS Firewall</b>. We had ample experience in using AWS Security Groups and Network ACL for setting up explicit access to internet-facing components and providing granular network access restriction.</li><li><b>AWS Web Application Firewall</b>. This tool is useful for checking HTTP headers and creating ACL for the protection of an application or API.</li><li><b>Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention</b>. This can be done using <em>snort </em>for discovering and preventing possible network intrusion points.</li><li><b>Intrusion detection</b>. We are actively using <em>sysdig Falco</em> for discovering OS intrusion attempts. These can include attempts of starting new processes, editing files within unwanted locations (/etc, /var/lib, etc.), executing bash commands, etc.</li><li><b>Updates and configuration management</b>. IT Svit is using Ansible for this. We store configuration in Git-based repositories and use Ansible Vault for sensitive data encryption. Alternatively, we can use OpsWorks to store configuration in Git-based repositories and provision AWS Stacks of EC2 hosts.</li><li><b>Storage encryption</b>. This can be done using LUKS. We enable storage encryption for cloud and non-cloud environments and use AWS KMS for encrypting access to EBS, S3 and other AWS services.</li><li><b>Environment management</b>. This is the core task for any enterprise using Active Directory and LDAP. The user profile is saved on the network storage, so when the user logs in from any PC in the same domain — he/she receives the user data: Downloads, Documents, Browser history, emails, etc.</li><li><b>K8s RBAC + KeyCloack + LDAP</b>. This toolchain is useful for enabling authentication and authorization services (LDAP + GitLab/Jenkins/Redmine/Youtrack/Grafana, LDAP + Windows7, LDAP + LinuxUbuntu Setup IAM credentials to containers running inside a Kubernetes cluster based on annotations (kube2iam))</li><li><b>AWS Identity and Access Management</b>. We are using it with Active Directory for configuring password policies and credentials rotation.</li><li><b>RBAC using AD Groups</b>. This provides explicit access to resources.</li><li><b>RBAC using Kubernetes Roles</b>. This helps grant explicit privileges to users and system processes on components.</li><li><b>RBAC using AWS IAM Roles</b>. We have experience in assigning roles with least-privilege default access so users gain permissions only after assuming a specific role. This also enables configuring explicit permissions on resources.</li><li><b>RBAC using AD and LDAP</b>. We can configure Single Sign-On feature and password policies (complexity, rotation). It is useful for explicit access management.</li><li><b>Credentials management</b>. This can be done using Hashicorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. We can secure explicit credentials access from applications.</li><li><b>Subnets management</b>. Using Private, Public Subnets and NAT Gateway we can secure internal infrastructure.</li><li><b>Secure network access to internal infrastructure</b>. We do this using Windows AD and Cisco ASA to enable Single Sign-On at the VPN level. Alternatively, this can be done using bastion hosts as an SSH Proxy hosts. There is no direct access to the bastion host from outside.</li><li><b>Secure network access through a VPN</b>. This is done through Public Key Infrastructure. Users have certificates within their clients with a specific TTL. When TTL expires or user access is revoked using CRL — the user loses the option to connect to a VPN host.</li><li><b>Reverse proxy and load balancing</b>. We do it using AWS: Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer. Otherwise, this can be done using Nginx to ensure load distribution and availability.</li><li><b>AWS Cognito</b>. We can set up it as the authentication and authorization service for distributed mobile applications with AWS API Gateway.</li><li><b>AWS Directory Service</b>. Another way to provide authentication and authorization is through configuring VDI infrastructure and using a Directory Service.</li><li><b>Email encryption</b>. We provide this service using PGP for secure email exchange.</li><li><b>Antivirus management</b>. IT Svit uses Kaspersky Endpoint Security for centralized antivirus management.</li><li><b>Subnets management</b>. We are experienced with using separate network layers (physical, VLAN) for separating different traffic e.g. public, private, backup, etc.</li><li><b>Updates and configuration management</b>. IT Svit uses the AD Group Policy for managing host settings and access rights for the distributed enterprise systems.</li></ul>

<p>Everybody can have a bright idea that might turn out to be a good product, even if you lack the money and the technical expertise needed to implement it. You can secure the investment and simply outsource product development and management in operations, so you can concentrate on growing your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we list (in no particular order) 50 startups from Ukraine that turned their ideas into great products and became a global success. Some of these startups outsourced the development of their products, some outsourced marketing, some built their production facilities in China — but the course of action all of them chose was correct.</p>



<p>All of them are known worldwide (though to a different degree) and all of them are listed as Active on Crunchbase, meaning they are still operating profitably. All you need to achieve this is an idea of how to solve a real-world problem (and do it better than the competition) implemented in a functional, easy-to-use and appealing product. Outsourcing helps a great deal with that, due to giving access to a pool of talented specialists, which reduces the time-to-market and development risks for your product, along with supporting its steady future growth.</p>

<p>Dmitriy Sergeev founded DepositPhotos in a basement office in Kyiv back in 2009. The website development was booming and content creators needed tons of DRM-free vector images and photos. A small team developed a convenient UI and several affordable subscription plans, which resulted in one of the 5 biggest photobanks worldwide 10 years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This startup attracted $5 million in 2015 from TMT Investments and EBRD when it already was a successfully growing product. Currently, DepositPhotos is headquartered in Florida, the US, has several international offices, employs more than 400 people and provides services in more than 190 countries, with estimated annual revenue topping $17 million.</p>



<p>However, Dmitriy Sergeev does not want to be remembered only as the creator of a photobank. In one of his interviews he stated that he is a serial entrepreneur by nature, and if an opportunity to do something great (and earn money) presents itself — like flying to the Mars with Musk — he will jump straight to it.</p>

<p>20 years ago we walked around with floppy disks. 15 years ago USB drives were thought the best way to transfer data between computers fast — but then Amazon launched AWS, its public cloud computing platform and the world has changed forever. Nowadays, everyone from freelancers to startups and global enterprises uses various cloud computing types to obtain, process and store all kinds of data and run their applications to generate revenues.</p>



<p>A forecast from IDC (International Data Corporation) promises worldwide spending on cloud services to reach $280 billion in 2021 and continue to grow at CAGR of 22%. However, while many companies have already adopted the cloud-first approach to their operations, many businesses are still unsure how to select the most suitable amidst different cloud computing types. This article will explore all you need to know about cloud computing types at a glance and will list business benefits to obtain from moving your IT operations to the cloud.</p>



<h2><b>What is cloud com</b>p<b>uting?</b></h2>



<p>What is cloud computing, in simple words? It is an approach to hardware utilization when all the computing resources owned by any cloud service provider are virtualized, pooled together and made available to users on demand. Every customer can scale their cloud instances up and down with ease to meet their workload challenges while paying only for the resources consumed (PAYG billing model), thus making the cloud much more cost-efficient, as compared to renting dedicated servers. Multiple cloud computing benefits like on-demand availability, simple scalability, high security and cost-efficiency of all IT operations are the factors that contribute to the growing adoption of the cloud by businesses around the globe.</p>



<p>Let’s just outline the infrastructure of a large corporation. Let’s say they have a data storage server that has to store all their financial records. If it was a single server, the enterprise risks losing all the data when its hard disk goes out of order. Therefore, at least a single replica is needed. But in order to ensure all the data is safely copied to both servers, you need a load balancer —&nbsp; a virtual machine on a third server, or just a third server.</p>



<p>Thus said, you need to maintain 3 servers and replace their faulty components st some time. You also have to pay for humidity control, cooling and fire control equipment, as well as have a secondary power supply on standby. Besides, the servers are hardly ever working at 100% of their capacity, so you always overpay for the resources you actually never used. Therefore, by combining CAPEX for purchasing hardware, software and supplementary systems with OPEX of paying for the maintenance and paying wages to IT specialists, you can see why the IT department is the cost center of expenses or any enterprise that wants to run its operations on-prem.</p>



<p>What is even worse, all these servers must be configured manually and separately. This always leads to a mess that should just be left alone, as restructuring it is literally impossible.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Itsvit_Types-of-cloud_screen_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7425"/></figure>



<p>Enterprises were trying to solve this challenge in several ways to meet their demands by sharing their physical computing resources.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Cluster computing — combining all the computers in a LAN into a single cluster. This allowed solving the tasks to resource-intensive for a single server, but reduced the performance of all the machines within the cluster, as their productivity was limited by the LAN throughput capacity.</li><li>Grid computing — combining the geographically distributed clusters to further increase the system computational power.</li><li>Distributed computing — connecting multiple devices in a ubiquitous landscape to provide peer-to-peer&nbsp; IT operations. ATM networks and Intranets/workgroups are good examples of such infrastructure.</li><li>Utility computing — providing disk storage, computing and various applications for a small fee, by virtualizing the resources of several servers. This concept grew into cloud computing as we know it today.</li></ul>



<p>Nowadays, large corporations and small startups alike use cloud computing to support their daily IT operations. It is useful for every industry — from small fintech startups to global manufacturing and retail giants, insurance and banking, real estate and telecom, software development and IT services.</p>



<h2>Basics of cloud computing operations</h2>



<p>As we briefly mentioned before, the main principle and killing feature of cloud computing is the fact that the resources provided to customers are elastic and can be scaled up and down independently in no time. With conventional dedicated servers, you have to buy or rent them in a remote data center in a pre-configured configuration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, if you don’t use all the server resources — you still pay in full. Secondly, if you ever need to increase the resources available, you need to buy another server — and double your expenses as hardware has quite limited horizontal scalability. Thirdly, but quite importantly, keeping an eye on your system parts and replacing the faulty components is your responsibility entirely, not to mention each adjustment is done manually and takes some time</p>



<p>Everything is different with the cloud. Your apps and data are still run on the same Linux (or Windows) server, but the way they are organized is totally changed. Computing resources of all the servers in all the racks in all the data centers are united into a common pool through virtualization. Every user pays for his/her <em>instance</em> — some quantity of computing resources assigned to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the project requirements change and you need more resources — these can be added in a single click in your cloud computing dashboard — both vertically (adding more preconfigured instances) and horizontally (adding more RAM or CPU power or disk storage space independently). Shutting down these resources also takes a single click only.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This process can be repeated as many times as you need with literally no effort wasted.&nbsp; Most importantly, new instances are provisioned automatically — and you never overpay for idle resources, not to mention there is no need to pay for additional equipment or server hardware maintenance. Cloud data centers purchase server hardware in droves, so they simply rep</p>

<h2>5 key benefits of cloud computing</h2>



<p>You can name all kinds of cloud computing benefits, based on your business niche and modus operandi. Here is our top 5 pick:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li><b>Scalability </b>— scale your systems up and down on-demand and with ease.</li><li><b>High availability </b>— instead of accessing a single server over the Internet, modern customers access your services via a variety of apps across a wide range of resources — and cloud powers every interaction.</li><li><b>Shorter time-to-market</b> — due to an ability to provide the required environments nearly instantly, the cloud empowers your IT team to greatly reduce the time needed for developing new product features or services, and shorter time-to-market means great competitiveness.</li></ol>



<ol><li><b>Better cost-efficiency</b> — you save a lot on CAPEX and get value faster out of your cloud computing investments, but OPEX can be huge in case of misconfiguration. However, due to the PAYG model, you pay only for the resources consumed.</li><li><b>Security </b>— MS Azure, serves 95% of the Fortune1000 companies — global leaders in their industries. AWS stores and processes the data for the US DoD and CIA. Rest assured, cloud security is top-notch, and all the latest advancements in that field are first delivered to cloud platforms.</li></ol>

<h2>3 different types of cloud computing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are three main types of cloud computing: providing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Let’s take a closer look at these different cloud computing types and explain what is the best use for each of them.</p>



<h3>What is Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS</h3>



<p>Your system engineers know better how to build a cloud environment to meet your project requirements. All they need for this are building blocks — and this is exactly what IaaS is all about. Cloud service providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Rackspace and others give DevOps specialists and system engineers access to the core of their platforms, so they can configure storage, networking, servers, security, deploy Terraform and Kubernetes and configure everything the way they need it, within the limits of their cloud account. But tread with caution, as errors can be quite costly with IaaS.</p>



<p>Back in the days, when AWS was a novelty that was actively growing and developing new features, one enterprise moved there from legacy infrastructure and enjoyed the scalability of the cloud. However, there was a minor bug in their operations — a data processing job was queued for execution, but never reporting successful completion. They thought it was caused by concurrency settings, so they just removed the limit on the number of jobs allowed to run at the same time.</p>



<p>In fact, the job was running, but failing due to incorrect process configuration. Once the limit on the concurrent jobs was removed, the system started spanning EMR clusters to perform the job and did it till it exhausted all the resources of us-east-1 Availability Zone. This resulted in an invoice for several million dollars awaiting the company in the morning. This case served as a basis for developing an internal AWS cloud monitoring solution, which later became AWS CloudWatch.</p>



<p>As you can see, IaaS is the most powerful — and the most error-prone of the cloud computing types.</p>



<h3>What is Platform-as-a-Service or PaaS&nbsp;</h3>



<p>PaaS is the next layer of the cloud computing pyramid. It means the cloud vendor provides various platforms as a service, which is very useful for developers. Due to PaaS, developers can use AWS CodeDeploy, CodePipeline and other tools, as well as Google App Engine or IBM Foundry to quickly develop their apps without ever having to configure the server.</p>



<p>Other PaaS tools include various cloud software, operating systems, middleware and all the environments required to support the software delivery lifecycle. These PaaS offers are accessed via the cloud vendor’s dashboard, are often activated and deactivated in a single click and allow hosting the required databases and data sets, BI tools and development solutions required on various stages of software development.</p>



<h3>What is Software-as-a-Service or SaaS</h3>



<p>SaaS is the uppermost level of the cloud pyramid. It includes IaaS and PaaS under the hood, but the customers cannot change anything apart from the settings of the software they consume. This is the level of applications like Office 360, Adobe products, Google G Suite, Salesforce and other cloud-native applications for businesses and individuals. You simply pay for receiving the functionality you need, but have no control over its installation, configuration or updates — all of this is done by the service provider.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Itsvit_Types-of-cloud_4-different-types_5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7428"/></figure>



<h2>4 different cloud computing types</h2>



<p>There are 3 different cloud computing services types, distinguished by the level of customer control over the cloud resources he uses. These types are public, private and hybrid cloud, as well as multi-cloud strategy —&nbsp; and all of them have their benefits and shortcomings.</p>



<h3>Public cloud</h3>



<p>Public cloud means you share your resources with all other customers in that Availability Zone, just like using a public restroom. It is a cheap, efficient and reliable way to host your customer-facing applications. You get the zero CAPEX, on-demand scalability, high-availability and security of the cloud — but you do not have any SLA coverage. In addition, you have no control over where your sensitive data is processed — and there are stringent regulations that limit the businesses to storing the PII of the US citizens on US soil, for example. Thus said, private cloud cand be the solution in this case.</p>



<h3>Private cloud</h3>



<p>The private cloud is a sector of public cloud dedicated to serving a single customer. This way you can ensure your sensitive data physically resides within the US boundaries if your regulatory legislation demands it. Thus said, you retain full control over the configuration of software and networking resources, while the provider is still responsible for hardware maintenance and utility bills. Alternatively, private cloud solutions can be built in on-prem data centers, which is the preferred approach of global banking and financial institutions, as well as scientific and governmental institutions. In that case, you need to use tools like OpenShift and OpenStack to build and manage your private cloud system.</p>



<h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>



<p>Hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private cloud, where an organization uses the unlimited resources of public cloud to process intense workloads while keeping all mission-critical data and systems running in the security of their private cloud. This is quite a popular approach for global corporations, who ensure both cost-efficiency and security of their IT operations with hybrid clouds.</p>



<h3>Multi-cloud strategy</h3>



<p>Nobody said you cannot use Amazon web services in tandem with Google Cloud platform — and so many companies do it. They build complex modular systems that include components from multiple cloud vendors and can sometimes even replace such modules with relative ease. This is a popular approach for global corporations, who have to run their workloads in regions not covered by any single cloud platform, so they have to combine services from several vendors.</p>



<h2>How to choose a reliable cloud computing provider</h2>



<p>Before selecting a cloud platform to deploy to, it is prudent to assess the range of its services, the data center locations, the pricing model, the customer support plans and data recovery scenarios available — in other words, it is good to have an in-depth knowledge of different cloud computing services and products to select the best fit for your project requirements.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span id="more-7445"></span>
<!--noteaser-->



<p>DevOps methodology of software development and infrastructure management is now the most popular approach to IT operations, as it allows to greatly reduce OPEX and decrease time-to-value while keeping the quality of products and operations high. This is why most businesses want to gain access to DevOps expertise in some way: hire it internally, as technical support from cloud providers or as managed services from remote DevOps companies. Today we list best DevOps services providers globally as of 2020.</p>



<p>However, how do you determine the company is good — or best, for that matter? Do you judge by the number of accolades received or by the number of projects completed? Or by the team size, or by the number of certifications from various cloud platforms? Not necessarily.</p>



<h2>Qualities of a good DevOps company</h2>



<p>A good technology partner — and the best one for your DevOps needs — should have several qualities that do not depend on the number of specifications, but can be easily checked during a technical call:</p>



<ul><li><b>Empathy</b>. When you receive feedback from your customers, they want to know you can hear them and be in their shoes. The same goes for talking with a DevOps provider when you are a customer — you want to make sure they hear you. During the technical call, they must ask questions and closer to its end they must be able to voice the problem statement themselves.<br><br>Unfortunately, many DevOps companies have been there too many times and each new project is just a sequence of actions for them. They might come up with ready solutions for your project before you even finish describing the requirements (as really, most projects involve very similar stages that every DevOps company has done a hundred times already).<br><br>However, it is very important to work with a team that approaches your product methodically and clears out all aspects of the project instead of discovering some obstacles amidst the implementation of the CI/CD pipeline.</li><li><b>Open-mindedness</b>. DevOps is the practical implementation of Agile methodology, but it does not mean it cannot be used with Waterfall processes. Many companies still do Waterfall operations for some good reasons — but they can benefit from DevOps to no lesser degree. <br><br>Your DevOps consulting partner must assess all your processes and tools in place and be able to suggest several quick wins (like providing a library of scripts for automated deployment and configuration of testing environments), which can reduce the time-to-value for your processes significantly. This might even help overcome the reason, however compelling it might be, for your team to use Waterfall — and help you become more Agile, efficient and productive. But Agile adoption must never be voiced as a prerequisite for DevOps implementation, as it can work without it.</li><li><b>Expertise</b>. 5 years is a good minimal term to master tools like AWS, Google Cloud, Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, etc. — and become certified accordingly. However, these tools are not the only ones your business can use — and many companies successfully use Puppet, Salt, Chef and other systems. <br><br>Therefore, the expertise you are looking for must not be centered on tools. Instead, it must be centered on <em>processes</em> like system design, cloud infrastructure management, software architecture planning, code deployment, monitoring and alerting, database management, etc. <br><br>In addition, the attitudes and soft skills matter a lot — as your team must be comfortable working with remote contractors and not be treated as useless freeloaders because they do not have the needed DevOp expertise yet. Warm and professional attitude forms productive long-term partnerships — and this is an important component to look for in IT outsourcing expertise.</li><li><b>Tolerance</b>. True professionals are quite often misanthropes who despise the people that do something inefficiently. It is easy for DevOps providers to obtain this attitude — as the demand for their services is quite high and most businesses out there are still only planning their DevOps transformation.<br><br>A good DevOps company will never adopt this attitude and will not point out the inefficient processes or performance bottlenecks as your fault. Instead, they will as for the reasons for such a decision and propose ways to improve the situation.</li><li><b>Modesty. </b>Try googling for “Most Popular open-source DevOps tools” or CI/CD tools, or monitoring tools for that matter. You will be flooded by titles and features, and selecting the most appropriate stack for your project might require investing quite a lot of time in figuring out what tools combinations will work best for you. <br><br>Due to the customers being generally not too well-informed of such details, most DevOps companies promote the tool stacks they are familiar with as being best. This is especially true for cloud service providers. Contact AWS, Google Cloud or Azure and ask their support representative for an estimated solution for your project. You can be sure the suggested infrastructure will be composed of vendor-specific tools and services. This is natural, as AWS support engineers know AWS products best, etc.<br><br>However, this a direct way to vendor lock-in and overpayment. Instead, a good DevOps company will suggest several possible infrastructure designs (mostly using open-source tools) and explain what are the benefits and downsides of each. This way you will be able to choose what fits YOU best.</li></ul>



<p>Thus said, we compiled a list of 15 best remote companies worldwide that gained a reputation for themselves not only through the number of projects they accomplished or the brands they worked with — but through their empathy, tolerance, open-mindedness, expertise and, most importantly, modesty — as there is nothing worse than showoffs who promise to be Jacks of all trades and fail the project. This list includes top-rated remote DevOps companies with multiple positive customer reviews, ratings from independent technology consultancy companies and a wide portfolio of successful business cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Internet is at its peak, and it doesn’t seem like it might slow down for another 20 years. It certainly has made the world smaller, but also it has created the opportunity of working anywhere from the world.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-7464"></span>



<p>A Remote developer is someone who works for a tech company from home or while traveling. This method offers a significant amount of flexibility for developers, as all they need is a laptop and an Internet connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remote work is a great way to beat the 9-5 office work and be your boss. It is now a trend in tech industries, and candidates also choose to work from their home at their own time whenever possible.</p>



<p>Tech companies can also boost productivity by doing this as they have to use fewer resources behind the employee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, there are a lot of Outsourcing companies out there that provide developers based on a fixed price or hourly rates. Hiring an agency can help you with your future projects also, while a remote developer may take your project or not; a company will pick it.</p>



<p>While the option of working remotely from home sounds great but finding a good remote developer for your company is like climbing a straight mountain; no matter how good your grips are, there is always some hidden risk involved. It is true that with platforms such as <b>UpWork</b> and <b>Freelancer</b>, it is easy to look for developers as per your requirement, but with tens of thousands of developers available, it is difficult to filter the good ones.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Programming Languages</li><li>Client-Server Architecture</li><li>Systems Engineering</li><li>Basics of Software testing</li><li>Databases</li><li>Encryption and Cryptography</li><li><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/directory/services/list-blockchain-technology-companies">Blockchain</a></li><li>Artificial Intelligence</li><li>Cross-platform Software</li><li>Operating Systems</li><li><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/cloud-computing-companies/kharkiv">Cloud Computing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/devops-companies/kharkiv">DevOps</a></li></ul>



<p>However, to find a developer for your project, it is crucial that you first define certain milestones to be as productive as possible and get the best results to form the whole process.</p>



<p>These are the few to-do lists when you set out to search for Remote Developers for your project:</p>



<h2>1. Define your project &#8211; What exactly you require</h2>



<p>Setting your result before even starting anything is very important. Setting a goal that what you want to see when the project is completed helps you keep in mind what you require and how you can avoid unproductive things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before you hire anyone, you need to do this, now as easy as it sounds, but this task is much harder than it looks. You need to be sure what kind of developer you need for your project and what specific skills he/she should possess to get the desired results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this is the most simplistic manner, sit down with a pen and paper, and start listing all the technical aspects that you will need to complete during the entire duration of your project. Doing this will help you get a checklist of skills that you will require from any <b>Remote Developer</b> that you hire.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. Which developers do you need?</h2>



<p>It depends on what kind of developers your project demands; it may even be a case you won’t need a developer but designer who can design certain portions of your website, app, or software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experienced developers can be found who have considerable command over languages such as C++, ELK Java, + Angular, stack, JavaScript, Kubernetes, Python, Vue.js, Terraform, Jenkins, Node.js, Docker, Grafana Prometheus React, Ruby-on-Rails, and many more software development platforms.</p>



<p>Also, designers prepare mockups of apps, and Front-end developers have to take the mockups and turn them into visual codes, but it is the job of back-end developers to make that design functional so that when a user clicks on that button, it will give the desired response.</p>



<p>Depending on your project, there will be a need for a designer, front-end developer, or back-end developer or any other kind like a full-stack developer. This will get you a perfect person with the skillset required to complete your project. An outsourcing agency can provide you with even a team for the duration of your project.</p>



<h2>3. The budget for your project</h2>



<p>Budget is one of the most important things for a business owner or an entrepreneur because as much low you can keep your expenses, the higher you will be able to invest in other areas. Determining the budget depends on a lot of factors like the current financial position, allocated funds, existing resources, and the required commodities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The budget of the whole project is made by aggregation of the cost estimates of individual activities, and after totaling all these, a final baseline is set, which is determined as a formal budget until any cost is added or subtracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the tech industry, the type of developer, as well as the skills possessed, will impact the cost of the project. If the developer is from some other nation, then the nationality of the developer will also affect the budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some agencies ask for <b>hourly pay</b>, and some ask for <b>fixed payment</b>, it is best practice to set the price beforehand and do go over budget. It is good to be upfront about everything so that the whole project can go smoothly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, where would you start looking to find developers?</p>



<p>There are many websites out there which provides you with the service to pick outsourcing company or developers. But here is a list of few popular sites that will get you best results,</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/">GoodFirms</a></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="615" height="235" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Top-Mobile-App-Development-Companies.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7466"/></figure>



<p>The best way, to begin with, is looking for Outsourcing agencies present in your desired region- like top IT companies in Canada. GoodFirms provide you the complete in-depth information on companies you are looking with the type of service they are expert in field.</p>



<p>The platform has helped more than <b>102,925</b> businesses to find the right software service companies and products.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.upwork.com/">UpWork</a></h3>



<p>This is the best platform to get started when it comes to hiring freelancers or agencies for your project. It requires a bit of a learning curve, but you can eventually get the hang of it after a while.</p>



<p>How UpWork works are that when you are required to post your job description and the freelancers will submit their proposal after reading your job description. The massive upside to using UpWork is that it is a paid platform, so freelancers who are severe enough will only submit their proposal to you. This way, you can filter out the skilled developers required for your project. The platform charges <b>10%</b> of the project once it is completed.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer</a></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="892" height="405" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/freelancer.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7467" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/freelancer.jpg 892w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/freelancer-768x349.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" /></figure>



<p>Founded in 2009, Freelancer offers multi-level paid partnerships and also an entry-level free membership, which comes with limited features. It provides the most significant marketplace with <b>32 million</b> registered active users on the platform.</p>



<p>The platform is easy to get familiar with, and has a lot of registered, it will be easier for you to go through all profiles and select developer that fits your requirements.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a></h3>



<p>LinkedIn is a network built for professionals and tailored to connect them. In the feed, there is always posting of requirements for various kinds of developers. You can use hashtags like <b>#fullstackdevelopers</b> to find developers you require.</p>



<p>There is also one side benefit that you can see the profile of the Outsourcing agency or the freelancer and decide how they can help you. Taking a look at the background can give you an understanding of how skilled a developer the company is offering. LinkedIn also offers a premium version that will enable you to reach to decision-making authorities like CEO or CTO and connect with them. This can undoubtedly increase your chances of knowing the company better and building a better relationship.</p>



<p>Few things to keep in mind&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Be <b>upfront</b> and <b>transparent</b> about your requirements with the developer, so it is a good practice to hire a developer who is fluent in the same language that you are. This will make the whole communication process go much smoother.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Build a good base for <b>long term relationship</b> with the Outsourcing company or Freelancer. You never know when you might need to work with that company again, so it is best to build a trustworthy relationship beforehand.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Having a <b>backup</b> is a good idea, especially when you are new to hiring from outsourcing companies. If the agency somehow fails to deliver or there is any mishap, your project would go on with the backup.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Do thorough <b>research</b> about the company before you hire them for your project. There are websites out there like <b>GoodFirms</b>, which will give you the details about the company as well as customer reviews to see how they execute the project.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Choose a platform that has <b>payment regulations</b> embedded in it. UpWork is such a platform, and this helps when there is an issue regarding payment, and you need an unbiased judgment.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you are non-technical and have to interview a developer for your project, then ask them to explain their previous projects and how did they solve the obstacles that came during the project duration. Their explanation would help you understand how their mindset is.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/company/it-svit"><b>ITSvit</b></a> is also present on <b>GoodFirms</b> and has received many good business ratings, multiple positive customer reviews, accolades and acknowledgments from our partners.

<p>Work from home has ceased to concern exclusively freelancers and has become commonplace for many businesses. Sometimes, remote work is a necessary measure. For example, part of the team is located in another city or your office is currently under repair/ relocation. Alternatively, the government might issue a quarantine and everyone needs to work temporarily from home.</p>



<p>Sometimes, an employee just needs to stay home for various reasons —&nbsp; he/she is waiting for a courier, is sick or does not want to get to the office in a snowstorm — not to mention IT outsourcing, when certain members of your team are locate outside of your office. In any case, it is important for the company to understand how to organize remote work for its employees and whether it is worth including remote work and outsourcing at all as a permanent option in the company.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Itsvit_Remote-work_pros-and-cons_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7408"/></figure>



<h2>The main pros of remote work and outsourcing</h2>



<p>The biggest plus of IT outsourcing and working with remote employees for the company is, of course, cost savings. You do not need to equip a workplace for them and pay for various other expenses, from renting additional office premises and equipment to paying utility bills and purchasing coffee with cookies. Plus, with such employees, it is more often possible to agree on piecework pay. In this case, you will not pay the rate every month, but will only pay for the tasks performed post-factum. This approach excludes the payment for prolonged coffee breaks and conversations in the smoking room.</p>



<p>The main benefit of IT outsourcing in this regard is the culture and established process of working with remote customers. Thus said, once the team implements and accepts daily reports, collaboration through VCS, project tracking systems like JIRA, YouTrack or Trello and communication through chats, where they work from becomes irrelevant.</p>



<p>Thus said IT Svit is one of the leading Managed Services Providers worldwide and among the leaders of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine. Over 10+ years of providing remote software development and 5+ years of delivering managed DevOps services allowed us to establish and polish remote communication processes. This way, now, when most businesses need to adjust to the quarantine, IT Svit just switched the whole team to working remotely and continues to perform our obligations as efficiently as ever.</p>



<p>What other benefits are there in working remotely with an experienced IT outsourcing provider?</p>



<ul><li><b>Instant access to a large pool of skills</b>. It might be hard to find some specific talent locally, especially if your company is not located in a major startup hub (and especially in the situation of quarantine). Quite the contrary, working with IT outsourcing provider grants instant access to teams of skilled professionals.</li><li><b>Professional teams</b>. Finding a talent does not equal to succeeding with the project. Forming a team out of multiple individuals takes time and effort, even more so in the situation of quarantine. Outsourcing your project to IT Svit helps with this too, as we house ready teams with polished processes, who can start working on your tasks at once and deliver value from day one.</li><li><b>Communication simplicity</b>. IT Svit provides remote work and IT outsourcing services to US and EU businesses for more than a decade. Our Sales Managers, Project Managers, and Team Leads are experienced professionals with fluent or Upper- Intermediate English proficiency. They will be able to easily understand your project requirements and transform them into precise specifications, so you can rule out the miscommunication possibility.</li><li><b>Operational efficiency</b>. Over the years we have accomplished a multitude of projects and have faced multiple typical challenges. This allowed us to gather a library of ready solutions and scenarios for most common tasks, which means we are able to provide much shorter time-to-value for your products.</li><li><b>Overlapping time zones</b>. IT Svit is headquartered in New York with R&amp;D center in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Our time zone is GTC+2, meaning our work hours overlap with most of the EU and for at least several hours a day — with various parts of the US. We are always online when you need us and respond promptly to all requests and inquiries.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>This is just a brief overview of the benefits your business gets when working remotely with a reliable IT outsourcing provider like IT Svit. But these benefits are quite often mentioned by multiple IT outsourcing companies, who are used to working remotely. What about organizing the remote work of your team, as you would naturally like to minimize the disruption to your normal operations?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Itsvit_Remote-work_Organizing_3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7409"/></figure>



<h2>Organizing remote work for your team</h2>



<p>Naturally, the companies that interact with their customers offline have to ensure adequate safety measures — or shut down or the quarantine period. However, worldwide quarantine is the time of opportunity for companies that interact with their customers online, and if you are such a business — organizing productive remote work is your highest priority. Nobody wants to sit idly with their hands on their laps — especially if you can spend the time actively growing your customer base!</p>



<p>In addition, as the quarantine situation is not likely to end quickly, the faster you are able to start moving at full speed again, the more likely you are to win the competition race.</p>



<p>Thus said, you will need to ensure your employees are able to contact each other, keep track of the tasks and report on their progress when working remotely. Luckily, most of modern IT tools are freely accessible from any device if you have a login and a password, so using them from home will be as easy as using them from the office for your staff. This includes the following:</p>



<ul><li>messengers like Slack,&nbsp;</li><li>issue tracking/project management systems like Jira or Trello,&nbsp;</li><li>Version Control Systems like Git,&nbsp;</li><li>Human Resource Management tools (Hurma System, BambooHR, Zoho People, etc.)&nbsp;</li><li>corporate Learning Management Systems (Open edX, Blackboard, Moodle, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>The exception are the Intranet platforms and other tools that are bound to certain IP addresses, as they will require your employees to configure VPN access from their home networks.<br><br>However, growing your product or service quickly can require adding more talent to your team, and remote recruitment/adaptation are quite hard (and nearly impossible during quarantine). This is when working with Managed Services Providers like IT Svit becomes even more beneficial — we provide end-to-end solutions, meaning we, most likely, already have the skills you need.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Itsvit_Remote-work_HR-work-remotely_4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7410"/></figure>



<h2>Pitfalls of remote work</h2>



<p>What pitfalls, besides changing the type of communication, can you expect? The most terrible challenges that can be encountered while working&nbsp; remotely are procrastination and distractions. Someone is perfectly concentrated at home, while another person is constantly distracted. If you or some of your employees working from home have a large family or small children who constantly distract from work, remote employment will become quite trying.</p>



<p>Regarding procrastination, there are a couple of tips that can help both you and your staff.</p>



<p>To get started, organize your workplace. Remote workers and freelancers who work in bed and feel great are very rare. When you have separate recreation and work areas, it is much easier to get together and tune in to tasks. Such zoning can be carried out even in one room. Make sure that the desktop is used exclusively for work, and all other areas in the house or apartment — for other activities.</p>



<p>As for distraction — you need your employees to explain to their families that they don’t chill at home — they work remotely now, and they are still as good as absent from 9 to 5 (they just can spend more time with the family in the morning and in the evening, as they don’t have to commute now).</p>



<h2>Conclusions: remote work is the new norm</h2>



<p>As you can see, you can safely let your employees and yourself work from home if this does not negatively affect productivity and you have discussed and planned all the issues related to work, schedule and necessary equipment. Everything is solved with the help of automation and the Internet. Thanks to modern technology, working from home can be not only enjoyable, but also no less productive than in an office.</p>



<p>The same goes to outsourcing. Having a reliable technology partner can be a significant advantage for your business — as you will still be able to get things done, while your competitors won’t. This way, the quarantine will not mean monetary and productivity losses for your business, as you will be able to accomplish all the tasks on time.</p>



<p>We have planned for contingency like quarantine from the start and are proud that our team works stably, allowing our customers to remain operational and productive. IT Svit was able to transition our whole team to work from home without issues during the COVID-19 quarantine — and we can help accomplish your projects on time!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/remote-work-the-new-norm-in-the-changing-world/">Remote work: the new norm in the changing world</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Every business that takes its long-term success and survival seriously must consider all ways to gain competitive edges over other market players. IT outsourcing is one of such ways, as it allows minimizing expenses, reducing risks and ensuring top-notch product quality while allowing you to concentrate efforts on other core business processes.</p>



<p>Naturally, we are talking about outsourcing your IT operations to a reliable contractor, as otherwise outsourcing can become a nightmare of broken deadlines, sub-par quality code, post-release crashes that affect customer experience and possible huge financial and reputational losses for your company. This is twice as important if you outsource something as mission-critical as cloud infrastructure management and software delivery for your products or services — in other words, DevOps operations.<br></p>



<p>Another point to consider is selecting the correct destination for outsourcing your business processes. Naturally, you’d want to entrust the delivery of the expected results to a team that has the relevant experience, can be easily reached during your working hours, has good written and fluent spoken English to exclude any possible miscommunication issues and has a proven reputation in the field. For the reasons listed above, many US and EU businesses prefer to work with offshoring and nearshoring providers from Ukraine, as it is one of the biggest IT hubs in Europe and houses a pool of nearly 200,000 skilled software engineers.<br></p>



<p>This is why the companies that want to reap the benefits of IT outsourcing have to ensure they contact the best IT services providers that can deliver on their promises. How to ensure this result? There are three popular approaches:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Googling for a team based on the skills you need,&nbsp;</li><li>Selecting among the top-rated contractors on freelance job portals like Upwork</li><li>Looking for positive customer reviews on technology consultancy platforms like Clutch or GoodFirms&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these approaches.</p>



<h2><b>Googling for DevOps skills you need</b></h2>



<p>If you are looking for DevOps services, you would need a team with several years of experience in the field, with multiple publications on their blog and independent resources showcasing their expertise, accolades from various rating companies, multiple social media mentions and other online activities. All of these actions add to the general online profile of the company and affect its standing in the SERPs. For example, this is what the first page of googling for “devops services” looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bIo2UuB_AvSZ2JtYhLrGxvZZ7Nlt7lETdsb7UbSTczJkk5HBGr57imrFQECkvSDwG-zR6j7YvU_70V7ns3SsajEf_mmsgo02fktyXBzPxLelGJGRocvRhJppogj53nzTYDwG4mKD" alt=""/></figure>



<p><b>Microsoft Azure</b> is one of the global leaders in software delivery and cloud infrastructure management. This cloud hosting provider is a backbone of the whole Microsoft Business Suite:</p>



<ul><li>Active Directory for managing thousands of employee profiles for global enterprises,&nbsp;</li><li>Office 365 for dealing with the document flow,&nbsp;</li><li>Outlook for email management and scheduling,&nbsp;</li><li>Skype for Business for communications and video-conferencing</li><li>various Azure web services, products and features to support software development and ongoing management, including Big Data analytics and ML/AI operations.</li></ul>



<p>Thus said, MS Azure is the leading provider of products and services for enterprise-grade cloud computing operations. If you are a global business with thousands of employees across the globe and already actively use Microsoft products in your daily operations, look no further for managed DevOps services and outsourcing your daily IT operations.</p>



<p><b>Accenture</b> is an independent technology consultancy and software engineering provider with 51 offices across the globe employing 505,000 experts and delivering services in 13 industries. They can deliver the DevOps services needed to move your business to the next level, using a wide variety of proprietary and open-source solutions and platforms. If you are a global geographically distributed enterprise with offices in countries across the globe and you need assistance with a wide variety of diversified projects with huge budgets — Accenture can become the right choice for you!</p>



<p>The next few positions of the list are occupied with job portal TopTal that offers the services of DevOps freelancers, an international IT corporation InfoPulse with an R&amp;D in Ukraine, a company from the Republic of Belarus and a Texan IT company, Veritis. The first Ukrainian DevOps service provider in this list is IT Svit — not an R&amp;D of an international corporation, but a nearshoring IT services provider for EU and US customers who want to hire skilled DevOps engineers in Ukraine.</p>



<p><b>IT Svit</b>, a Managed Services Provider from Ukraine that delivers end-to-end software solutions and cloud infrastructure management services for businesses of all sizes from various industries. IT Svit provides managed AWS and Google Cloud services, full-stack web application development, Big Data analytics and Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence algorithm training.</p>



<p>IT Svit team has 15+ years of experience in delivering IT services for companies from banking and finances, marketing and software development, eCommerce and blockchain solutions delivery, etc. IT Svit specializes in delivering dedicated teams for end-to-end software delivery, building cloud monitoring solutions and CI/CD pipelines for automating routine IT operations, delivering DevOps services for all stages of the SDLC.</p>



<p>As you can see, googling for the required services helps select among a wide range of providers that can cater to all your business needs and help reach the goals set.</p>



<h2>Selecting among the top-rated contractors on freelancing portals like Upwork</h2>



<p>If you prefer to select contractors based on their proven work experience, you can browse among top-rated teams on portals like Upwork. What to look for?</p>



<ul><li><b>Look for relevant expertise</b>. It is natural to want to hire talents experienced in the exact field of services you need. If you need a web app developed &#8211; look for web app developers, and if you need DevOps services to empower your development process — search for them.</li><li><b>Look for a team, not an individual</b>. While many startups think they need a full-stack developer, they actually need a dedicated team to deliver their project. Even if you find an insanely skilled individual, chances are he will lack some skills that will disable the completion of your project. With agencies, you are sure to get the full skillset you need for your project to succeed.</li><li><b>Look for top-rated teams</b>. If you want to work with proven professionals, look for the teams with 90%+ customer satisfaction rate.</li><li><b>Look for average pricing</b>. The teams that are willing to work for under $10 an hour are usually not skilled enough to successfully complete a cloud migration or infrastructure optimization project. It is better to hire someone who knows their job well, while not charging too much.</li><li><b>Look for long-term contractors</b>. You’d want the team you work with to be there in half a year if you need some adjustments or updates to the project. Thus said, it’s best to work with teams that have 1,000+ hours billed and have earned more than $10,000 on Upwork — this way you ensure you hire a reliable long-term partner for your business.</li></ul>



<p>If we apply all the filters mentioned above — the very first result would be Spaceport, an IT services provider from Ukraine. We are sure this team would be able to deliver projects of any scope with high quality, on time and under budget — their Upwork rating proves this!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EYJwvR_mZpb7bB2CQxrc0FLr7cgJgOhE8ZKcbqNHsrbmlila3X-ofTeW_ub4s1Gy4EiPjbExHatwO5I3cbrG_Jq0MNrR5kML3wY8n8sRgh58YWihwLSKXjThd8H8nBx1m28xsViy" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Naturally, you can try searching by lists of particular skills you want to use for your project, like Python/Django/Flask, Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible, Docker, Jenkins, AWS cloud administration, Google Cloud administration, etc. We found multiple Ukrainian IT service providers like <a href="https://www.upwork.com/agencies/~01981e748093ed3946">HireUkraine</a> this way — and they also were top-rated on Upwork and had a huge range of skills to offer to potential customers.</p>



<h2>Looking for positive customer reviews on B2B technology consultancy platforms</h2>



<p>There are various technology consulting platforms like TrustPilot, Clutch or GoodFirms. These agencies rank contractors based on independent reviews from their customers. The best way to get a positive review is by providing diligent and professional services, naturally. If a customer is fully satisfied with the company’s services, they are more likely to share their positive customer experiences — and the more responses a company has, the more it proves the professionalism of the company.</p>



<p>For example, if we search for the leaders of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine on Clutch, we will find the same IT Svit company you can see while googling for DevOps services.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Jg-SlR-aPsttYMMyYoM_h_oUdp4De7e8GJaAK1ZX1qSdweojXcmsfzCDeJP5oY9EjQF_6fhwXYmN9KvhbimnLHBIGcNl3ZTRhZujSgFQsdpEIY-32EPuNfM4sUS6eiMPtpZ4zsBw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Alternatively, if you search for DevOps services based on customer reviews, IT Svit is listed as the leader of the market in Ukraine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yH7bCL4Yh4pLDT7erjzdC266NIcXReJckwaQdZGDrj5VzPWVzihQwl5qWR3BezySYaf_xqu0iTRqoQKChJ3gATD8hnYu5vuKsNPqWjLvzNiM1gr5oBtvxsUmOApBE1EOPU5j8jCA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Thus said, we have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of selecting the reliable IT services by a Google search, from top-rated contractors on freelance platforms and based on ratings from trustworthy business rating agencies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ItSvit_Cost-of-Devops_conclusion_2-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7266"/></figure>



<h2>What are the costs of hiring a DevOps engineer in Ukraine?</h2>



<p>Okay, you have selected a company you want to hire to deliver DevOps services. How much will you have to pay for them?</p>



<p>While most of the contract prices are hidden under the NDA, some companies post their prices and minimal project budgets directly. For example, the full pricing of MS Azure services is publicly available on their website, while Accenture does not disclose their pricing publicly and you have to contact their sales department to get an estimate of your project costs.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ukrainian companies like IT Svit, SpacePort or HireUkraine publish their hourly rates on Clutch, Upwork, GoodFirms, etc.</p>



<p>For example, an hourly rate for hiring a DevOps engineer from one of the leading Ukrainian Managed Services Providers would be as follows:</p>



<ul><li>IT Svit — $40 &#8211; $65 / hr with $10,000+ minimum project budget</li><li>HireUkraine — $40.00 &#8211; $46.00 / hr with $5,000+ minimum project budget</li><li>Spaceport — $45.00 &#8211; $65.00 / hr with $5,000+ minimum project budget</li></ul>



<p>Therefore, every business can find a reliable IT Services provider for a project of any size and hire a DevOps engineer in Ukraine (or a whole dedicated team for software development and/or infrastructure management) for an affordable budget. We are sure you will find a trustworthy partner in any of the companies listed above, and if we can help with any other question — please let us know!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/cost-of-a-devops-engineer-in-ukraine-and-abroad-a-comparison/">Cost of a DevOps engineer in Ukraine and abroad: a comparison</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<!--noteaser-->



<p>2019 was a very productive year for IT Svit: we entered new markets around the globe; our product HURMA System passed the breakeven point, gained nearly 400 customers and attracted new investments; we were listed among top 1000 IT companies worldwide for the third time in a row by global technology consultancy Clutch; we took part in multiple conferences and expos and formed new partnerships; our team grew by 25% and we keep on expanding. Continue reading to find about IT Svit achievements and results of 2019, a description of our plans for the nearest future and the types of projects we are currently able to deliver.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="215" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ITSvit_2019_Hurma_2-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7260"/></figure>



<h2>HURMA System — an internal tool that became a successful product</h2>



<p>One of the most important achievements of 2019 for IT Svit was the fact that our product, <a href="https://hurma.work/en/">HURMA System</a>, surpassed the breakeven point. What once began as an internal tool to solve certain issues became one of the leaders of the HRIS/HRM systems market in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, when the size of the IT Svit team exceeded 50+ people, our HR and recruiter found themselves buried in routine, as they had to repeat the same actions time and again, and answer the same questions every day. We decided to implement some Human Resource Management system to automate the routine and improve the efficiency of our HR and recruitment processes. However, none of the systems available on the market at the moment satisfied our needs in full — all were either too expensive, not localized or not adapted to the reality of the Ukrainian job market and business processes.</p>



<p>Thus said, we decided to develop an internal tool for our needs using our vast expertise with web development and DevOps services for building software delivery pipelines. We created a simple mockup, built it with Bootstrap and adjusted it daily based on the feedback from our employees and HR specialists. It worked fine and cost us literally nothing, so we were fully satisfied with it — until our CEO, Vladimir Fedak mentioned we have such a tool on one of the conferences he attended.</p>



<p>The demand for a cheap and functional HRM tool appeared to be so huge, that all the conference attendees had to photo a single business card Vladimir had on him, and nearly 40 companies promised to buy the system when it was market-ready. This showed us that the tool we had built to solve our internal challenges had the potential to become a successful product, so we allocated enough resources to turn a pet project into a market-ready solution. We titled it the HUman Resource MAnagement system — HURMA.</p>



<p>The release was in September 2018 and by March 2019 HURMA system reached the breakeven point. Due to constantly integrating customer feedback and engaging the expertise of several HR specialists we were able to build and quickly improve a system that met all the expectations of our customers, was built with an understanding of local business practices and legislation, and was 8-10 times more affordable, as compared to competitors.</p>



<p>As of the end of 2019, we have nearly 400 customers, and attracted several external investors. Hurma development team grew from 6 to 22 people, and the system is used by the industry-leading Ukrainian companies in several domains:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://banda.agency/">Banda Agency</a> and <a href="https://aimbulance.com/eng/">Aimbulance</a> in marketing,&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://yalantis.com/">Yalantis</a> and <a href="https://remme.io/">Remme</a> in web and mobile development,&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.unisender.com/en/">UniSender</a> and <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> in email marketing,&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://orner.com.ua/">Orner</a> in event management,&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://hubber.pro/en/">Hubber</a> in eCommerce,</li><li><a href="https://www.interkassa.com/">INTERKASSA</a> in online payment processing, etc).</li></ul>



<p>We have already expanded to several CIS countries and work with customers in the Republic of Belarus, Republic of Kazakhstan, and more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ITSvit_2019_Bot_3-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7257"/></figure>



<p>In 2019 the system received a number of important and useful updates.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>An AI-powered chatbot AI Partner that allows using multiple HURMA functions on your smartphone with a convenient chatbot.</li><li>A 1-click vacancy publication on a corporate website and a wide variety of job portals in Ukraine and other countries due to powerful API integrations</li><li>A convenient LinkedIn plugin that automatically downloads the potential candidate profile to the system.&nbsp;</li><li>An AI-powered CV parser, which automatically downloads key details from CVs from a variety of formats (.pdf, .csv, .txt, .rtf, .docx, etc.)</li><li>An integration with CleverStaff, allowing to import candidate profiles from this popular ATS in a single click</li><li>many more useful features and updates.</li></ul>



<p>We are looking toward 2020 with the firm assurance of ongoing growth and we have a vast public <a href="https://hurma.work/en/#functional">roadmap of new functions</a> to implement. For example, we have begun adding payroll functions to enable the businesses to track their work hour accounting and billing tasks in the same system they use to track sick leaves, days off, vacations and other types of employee absences. Centralizing all recruitment, HR and billing processes would be of huge help for small-to-medium businesses that have to do it in Google spreadsheets or using a bunch of disparate tools.</p>



<p>Another important addition would be an integration with an LMS system to support internal adaptation, corporate training and mentorship. This is crucial for companies from various industries — from retail and logistics to software development and customer support services — who need to train large numbers of employees quickly, often remotely and ensure they have a good understanding of work processes, and a convenient knowledgebase to refresh their knowledge and answer various questions if need be.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ITSvit_2019_4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7255"/></figure>



<h2>IT Svit accolades and recognition</h2>



<p>IT Svit finished at the 104th position on the list of the <a href="https://clutch.co/press-releases/recognizes-1000-best-b2b-service-providers-its-exclusive-2019-1000-list">top 1000 IT services providers worldwide by Clutch,</a> the world-leading technology consultancy and B2B rating company from Washington, D.C. This is the third time in a row when we are listed among the best B2B providers by Clutch — we made it to the list in 2017 and 2018, too. More importantly, we are listed among the <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/ukraine/leaders-matrix">leaders of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine</a> and one of the <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/msp/leaders-matrix">top 3 Managed Services Providers worldwide</a> on the platform.</p>



<p>These accolades and recognition are possible due to us getting more than 30 positive <a href="https://clutch.co/profile/it-svit#reviews">IT Svit customer reviews</a> with Clutch. These reviews showcase the wide range of services we provide and highlight the invariable professionalism and dedication of our work. We are sure that in 2020 we will rise higher on this list and help many more businesses successfully accomplish their projects and achieve their business goals.</p>



<p>Yet another popular business rating platform, <a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/devops-companies">GoodFirms, ranked IT Svit as №2 among all DevOps services providers</a> worldwide and №1 in Ukraine. We are sure IT Svit will be listed as №1 MSP on GoodFirms in some time!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ITSvit_2019_year-of-new-skills-and-partnerships_5-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7262"/></figure>



<h2><b>2019 — a year of new skills and partnerships</b></h2>



<p>Over 14+ years in business, IT Svit has gathered significant expertise spanning web development and QA, DevOps cloud infrastructure management and software delivery automation, continuous monitoring and smart alerting, Big Data analytics and processing, blockchain development, IoT solutions, etc. We are always open to mastering the latest technologies in order to be able to assist with implementing them for our customers.</p>



<p>With AWS, Google Cloud and Azure heavily concentrating on data science, Big Data analytics and training ML/AI models to support various business processes, IT Svit team spared no effort in mastering these technologies in 2019. This helped us further increase our substantial Big Data expertise and use it in a variety of projects, from training ML models for various user-facing features in the HURMA system and other projects to building self-healing cloud infrastructures using predictive analytics for our customers.</p>



<p>We have also entered new markets and expanded the geographical diversity of our partners. We are working with businesses from the US, UK and France since 2015. Last year we delivered some contracts for customers from Japan, the Persian Gulf, and Scandinavian countries. In 2019 we signed long-term contracts with customers from Switzerland, Germany and new US partners.</p>



<h3><b>DevOps support for a business cloud integrator</b></h3>



<p>We work with the Chairman of the Board at a business cloud integrator and vendor for various open-source and custom software solutions from Switzerland. The customer requires long-term DevOps support to implement in-depth monitoring and assistance with geographically distributed teams of outsourcers, who provide software delivery processes for a wide variety of internal projects.</p>

<p>There are various reasons for IT outsourcing, as businesses can delegate some tasks to reliable contractors and concentrate on core expertise instead. Ukraine is a long-term partner and one of the most preferable IT outsourcing destinations for the EU and US businesses. In 2020, another compelling reason for Ukrainians to work at home is the ever-strengthening currency, as Ukrainian hryvnya has strengthened 19% in 2019.</p>



<p>The benefits of working with an IT outsourcing company for an EU or US business are numerous:</p>



<ul><li>instant access to a pool of highly skilled software engineers,&nbsp;</li><li>significant reduction of time-to-market for new product features,&nbsp;</li><li>reduction of risks related to software development, like tighter deadlines,</li><li>higher software development quality (fewer mistakes and bugs),&nbsp;</li><li>lower expenses on salaries and infrastructure operations,</li><li>legal coverage due to SLA and NDA.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ItSvit_2020_list_2-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7246"/></figure>



<p>This applies to work with any IT services provider across the globe, though. Why do we say Ukraine is the best choice for finding a reliable IT outsourcing partner?</p>



<ul><li><b>A huge pool of skilled talents</b>. Ukraine has a fairly developed system of higher education and many universities there produce students with a high level of theoretical technology knowledge. Later, these people become Junior IT specialists and quickly grow into Middle and Seniors. According to estimates from DOU, the leading Ukrainian IT-related portal, there are approximately 160,000 software developers and DevOps engineers in Ukraine as of 2019.</li><li><b>Large number of experienced professionals</b>. Out of these 160,000 IT specialists, nearly 35% are Juniors and approximately 30% fall to Middle and Senior level talents respectively. Thus said, most of Ukrainian IT outsourcing companies can quickly form the required teams for any project requirements and complexity.</li><li><b>Fluent English</b>. Being the language of international communication, English is extremely important in IT outsourcing. Most Ukrainian IT professionals can speak English fluently or at least at the Intermediate level, which is enough to ensure transparent and frictionless business communication.</li><li><b>Overlapping time zones</b>. The Ukrainian time zone is GMT +2:00, so it mostly overlaps with the EU business time and covers most of the US evening. This makes it very convenient for the US and UK businesses, as the tasks can be done and discussed at once for Europeans or will be done overnight for the US businesses. This speeds up software development considerably.</li><li><b>Cultural fit</b>. Ukraine is a European country with a Westernized culture and mindset, so Ukrainians celebrate Christian religious holidays and these are not too numerous. Thus said, Ukrainian teams have a good cultural fit with the US and EU customers and can ensure the projects roll out according to a schedule.</li><li><b>Polished workflows and ready solutions</b>. Many Ukrainian companies have 5+ years of IT outsourcing expertise under their belts. This means these teams have polished workflows and established processes, which ensures timely delivery of required services and products. Most importantly, while each project is unique, accomplishing multiple similar projects helps identify common challenges and prepare solutions for them. Thus said, experienced IT outsourcing companies in Ukraine can deliver software products and solutions much quicker, as they don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time.</li></ul>



<p>To sum it up, some companies in Ukraine can become one-stop shops for all your IT-related needs and tasks. The companies that can provide the full cycle of IT services for businesses of all sizes are called <a href="https://themanifest.com/it-services/msp/companies">Managed Services Providers</a>, and they are able to deliver end-to-end solutions for various aspects of IT operations — from MVP development and automated QA to seamless software releases and real-time monitoring.</p>



<p>IT Svit is one of such companies and a <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/ukraine/leaders-matrix">leader of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine</a>, so we know the situation in the Ukrainian IT industry firsthand. And we see that 2019 was marked by a significant increase in the variety and quantity of Ukrainian IT outsourcing projects and startups. Grammarly, the world’s most popular grammar checker was one of the <a href="https://www.lift99.co/blog/ukraines-top-startups-launching-the-wall-of-fame">top 15 Ukrainian startups that launched the Wall of Fame in 2019</a>.</p>



<p>Thus said, instead of aiming to relocate to Western European countries, more and more Ukrainians prefer to work and start their business in Ukraine, which is proven by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/world-s-best-performing-currency-cools-ukrainians-lust-to-leave">Bloomberg’s research on the currency strengthening rate in 2019</a>. As hryvnya (UAH), the national currency strengthened 19% in 2019, more jobs became much more competitive in Ukraine and even the specialists that emigrated previously prefer to go back and work in Ukraine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ItSvit_2020_conclusion_3-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7248"/></figure>



<h2>Final thoughts: what does 2020 have in stock for the Ukrainian IT outsourcing business?</h2>



<p>IT Svit develops our own product — <a href="https://hurma.work/en/">HURMA System</a>, an end-to-end platform for recruitment and HR management processes, and it has nearly 400 customers a year after the release. With 80%+ of our customers being IT companies, mostly IT outsourcing providers, we keep the hand on the pulse of the IT industry. A significant portion of our customers has doubled their service packages over this year, meaning their teams grow rapidly — as the numbers of their contracts grow.</p>



<p>We are sure 2020 will continue to bring new partnership possibilities between US and EU businesses and Ukrainian IT outsourcing companies. With the stabilization of the UAH exchange rate and growth of the Ukrainian economy, ever more mutually beneficial contracts are sure to emerge. As for IT Svit, we are always ready to lend our DevOps and software development expertise to a company of any size from any industry to help you reach the business objectives set. Contact us today and let’s start working on your next project tomorrow!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/why-2020-is-a-great-time-for-it-outsourcing-to-ukraine/">Why 2020 is a great time for IT outsourcing to Ukraine</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>You have doubtlessly heard about the benefits of IT outsourcing for several dozens, if not hundreds, times already. These include better cost-efficiency, instant access to skilled talents from elsewhere, shorter time-to-market for your products or services, and better allocation of your resources and efforts, as you can concentrate on your core business expertise while the professionals deal with some specific tasks.</p>



<p>However, the lack of trust in the IT outsourcing provider is a major issue that stops many companies from outsourcing their services to professionals. IT Svit team works with startups mostly, so we encounter this challenge regularly and solve it by publicly showcasing our project execution strategy and roadmap. Below we explain how we do this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ItSvit_trust-your-IT-outsourcing_project-execution-strategy_2-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7241"/></figure>



<h2>IT Svit project execution strategy&nbsp;</h2>



<p>IT Svit can step in on any stage of your project lifecycle — from refining the idea to MVP development, release and providing long-term infrastructure support and product updates. We work under NDA and SLA, follow the code review best practices and try to automate the routine operations wherever possible by implementing CI/CD pipelines.</p>



<ol><li><b>Assessment of the existing systems</b>. We begin with gathering input from your business stakeholders to build a cohesive picture of the infrastructure, tools and processes already in place. This helps us<b> identify the performance bottlenecks and room for improvement</b>. Once we know what can be done better, we select the performance criteria to be monitored and then offer 3 kinds of solutions:<br>&#8211; <em>cost-efficient infrastructure</em> and workflows to turn your IT operations into a lean, mean, frugal machine. This helps get MVP development and release done quickly and with minimal expenses;<br>&#8211; <em>scalable solutions</em> to support ongoing business growth and lay grounds for further product improvements;<br>&#8211; <em>highly-available systems</em> for long-term business success and scaling to an enterprise.</li><li><b>Constant communications</b>. We keep our customers informed on the project progress in multiple ways, from weekly sync-up calls to daily reports in your preferred communication channel like Slack. We list the current roadblocks, things to be discussed and plans for today in the morning and report on the progress done in the evening. This helps us keep our workflows flexible and change project priorities quickly and easily if your business focus shifts. We work in week-long sprints that enable constant value delivery to our customers.</li><li><b>Detailed developer documentation</b>. We are a reputed Managed Services Provider and our customers recommend our services to their friends and partners due to our high level of professionalism. We always provide detailed developer documentation for all our projects, starting with infrastructure description and describing the whole set of workflows and functions available within the scope of the project.</li></ol>



<p>We are often asked what would stop us from abusing the customer’s trust and stealing some vital information. We understand that many companies have had a negative experience with IT outsourcing companies in the past and now they are reluctant to trust us. However, our reputation is valuable to us, like yours is to you, and we uphold our end of the bargain. We always sign NDA and SLA agreements to keep both parties legally protected.</p>



<p>According to a global technology consultancy provider Clutch from Washington, D.C., we are among the <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/ukraine/leaders-matrix">leaders of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine</a>, one of the <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/msp">top 3 Managed Services Providers worldwide</a> and are listed among the top 250 Global IT Leaders in 2017-2019 yy. We are also listed as <a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/devops-companies">№2 DevOps provider worldwide by GoodFirms</a> — and we are sure to become №1 there with time!</p>



<p>You can simply google for IT Svit customer reviews or ask us for references — we can put you in touch with any of our customers, who will be able to prove our professionalism and high quality of our services.</p>
