<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer required the following services:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a multi-cloud architecture for running containerized blockchain nodes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Containerize all cryptocurrency apps running in the system</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure a Kubernetes cluster to run EOS and deploy all the pods/services/deployments prepared</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure Multi-Availability-Zone deployments within a single AWS region with High Availability within that region</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enable minute monitoring of system performance</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Challenges and solutions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While working on this project, we had to solve several challenges:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensuring fault tolerance with minimal downtime for all blockchains supported</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This had to be done for Tendermint blockchains — Cosmos, Terra, Iris, etc. We needed to ensure only one block producer is active at any given time and the downtime between spinning up different producers is minimal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — We deployed the system in 2 regions with the same infrastructure and launched a HashiCorp Consul server tracking the state of the active region. This enabled monitoring the platform performance, and if any issues arise in one region, the producer is stopped in one region and launched in the other.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensuring an automated system failover and data recovery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is a possibility that blockchain podes will remain offline long enough for the blocks to be completed with errors. In this case, we need to evaluate the data relevance and replace the outdated blocks with the relevant data from the backups in another region.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— we enabled separate pode backups for every region and created a script checking the timestamp of the last file update.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensuring continuity of operations and automated bans for blockchains after 30 minutes out of consensus</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Due to the fact that Tendermint blockchains produce blocks very quickly (once every 6-7 seconds), we need to be informed within 1-2 minutes if the blockchain is out of consensus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— All logs are monitored with Log exporter, alerts are sent to Alert Manager in Prometheus and we are able to react very quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Automated checks for new blockchain versions and building Docker images for them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We need to build the blockchain applications using the latest stable version, after checking the source code and the installed packages for security vulnerabilities. We must also ensure the apps are not launched from under the root user.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— We solved this by configuring 2 Jenkins jobs. The first job checks for new blockchain app version, the second one builds a new image after testing the code and packages for vulnerabilities. When the image is updated, the second job sends a notification to Slack.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Enabling real-time two-level monitoring.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We needed to ensure nobody was able to mishandle the blockchain apps, which meant the need to implement an in-depth monitoring solution capable of instantly alerting of any suspicious activity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— We use Falco and custom rules to monitor external container access attempts or incorrect node behavior</span><b>.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Implementing robust user authentication and access rights configuration. </b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to ensure there is no way any Kubernetes cluster pod is able to access the cloud provider’s resources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— We used kiam (Kubernetes Identity &amp; Access Management) agents to configure limited access rights assigned to each individual pod.</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Svit team was able to configure the multi-cloud architecture able to run on AWS resources, IBM Cloud and Google Cloud Platform. We’re running and maintaining  the following blockchains so far:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algorand     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmos     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dash     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decred    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EOS    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EOS CryptoKylin    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factom on production    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factom on staging     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livepeer     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tezos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ecosystem is built leveraging Kubernetes autoscaling and auto-healing features including load balancing and failover to several geographically distributed regions. It has enabled robust CI/CD implementation and new blockchain version rollout automation. Infrastructure as Code approach has empowered the speed of the new blockchains onboarding from weeks at the start to hours now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-depth two-level real-time monitoring leveraging Sumologic, Prometheus, Grafana, Sysdig and Falco saves us a lot of time and effort for tracing and nailing issues down, as well as raises team awareness about relevant blockchain states. As a result, the system elastically scales up to handle heavy workloads, keeps a high quality of service and improves platform popularity.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to having precise project requirements, the IT Svit team was able to provide all the deliverables on time. Once the first set of blockchain apps was containerized and the monitoring implemented, the only remaining challenge was to add new cryptocurrency to the system as quickly as it was available according to the customer needs.</span></p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/kubernetes-cloud-architecture-consultancy-for-blockchain-startup/">Kubernetes & cloud architecture consultancy for blockchain startup</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The goal of the project was to use the blockchain technology to replace the excise stamps with QR-codes. This would provide immense benefits:</p>
<p><span id="more-6015"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>reduce the spending</b> on creating the excise stamps by approx <b>90%</b>,</li>
<li><b>reduce </b>the risk of fraud and counterfeit to 0,</li>
<li><b>increase the tax revenues</b> by nearly <b>100%</b></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the percentage of counterfeit alcohol sales can reach up to <b>55%</b> of the country’s official statistics (about <b>$450 million a year</b> in the case of Ukraine).</p>
<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>The QR-code should be used the same way an excise stamp is used nowadays, just without the possibility to forge it. It should be issued by the governing body and store the date and location of producing each unit of excise goods. As, an example, the QR-codes for cigarettes would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code on the pack contains the details of the production location, date and batch number</li>
<li>The code on the block contains the hashes of all the pack QR-codes within</li>
<li>The code on the box contains the hashes of all the block QR-codes within</li>
<li>The code on the pallet contains the hashes of all the box QR-codes within</li>
<li>The code on the batch contains the hashes of all the pallet QR-codes in it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project results</h2>
<p>The system works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The regulator prints the QR-codes</li>
<li>The manufacturer marks the goods with QR-codes and packs them</li>
<li>The tokens are put into “packaged” state</li>
<li>Once the wholesale distributor splits the batch, the tokens are updated and the pallet codes are activated</li>
<li>The same process goes all the way down to a single pack of cigarettes</li>
<li>The customers can scan the item QR-codes to ensure their validity</li>
<li>Once the item is sold, its token is put to “sold” state, closing the block</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the immutability of blockchain ledger, the counterfeit goods are identified at once during scanning. All the textual details are stored in the cloud, only the transaction hashes are stored in the ledger. The scanning takes milliseconds and the data uses literally no disk space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Location:</b> Ukraine</p>

<h3>Client’s goals</h3>
<p>The main goal of the project was to guarantee the validity of the goods and remove the chance of counterfeit. This would ensure the increased tax revenues and provide the efficient means of control over the goods delivery.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Transparency</b> — due to the blockchain architecture, the system is able to highlight the status of each item, whether it is “packaged”, “delivered” or “sold”</li>
<li><b>Immutability</b> — the open ledger ensures the records cannot be altered and the destination of each item can be tracked</li>
<li><b>Legitimity</b> — the codes cannot be forged, as scanning a forged code will reveal the fact of counterfeit at once</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Feasibility</b> — replacing the expensive (and forgeable) excise stamps with inexpensive (yet unforgeable) QR-codes would ensure both cutting the stamp production costs and increasing the tax revenues from the distribution of excise goods.</p>

<h3>Implementation and challenges resolved</h3>
<p>IT Svit team has a wide experience in developing blockchain-based solutions for multiple industries. We leveraged this knowledge to accomplish all the tasks of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using<b> Ethereum smart contracts</b> allowed us to deliver a flexible and highly configurable platform that can interact with multiple third-party software modules through API</li>
<li>All the textual details are stored in the <b>MongoDB in the cloud</b>, and only the transaction hashes are stored within the blocks. This leads to minimal usage of system resources and allows the transactions and checks to happen in milliseconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>We delivered both a web portal and a <b>lightweight blockchain wallet</b> for checking the <b>QR-code status</b> through a mobile device</p>

<h3>Client’s goals</h3>
<p>The main goal of the project was to enable the eCommerce shoppers to gain and spend the discount coupons anywhere inside a network of online retail shops. The main benefit for the retailers was the ability to specify the rules of discount coupon issuing and track where the coupons are applied.</p>
<p>The main benefits of the system are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Integrity</b> — our platform supports online shops on Shopify, WooCommerce and Magento</li>
<li><b>Simplicity</b> — the shop owners can issue any amount of discounts and specify the rules of applying them</li>
<li><b>Utility</b> — the customers can use the coupons themselves anywhere across the network or give them as a gift to any other user</li>
<li><b>Analytics</b> — the platform allows tracking each coupon, thus providing the useful analytics on where and how they are applied. This allows the shop owners to adjust their offers and increase the profits.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation and challenges resolved</h3>
<p>While implementing this project, IT Svit has resolved the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>We created an intuitive and useful <b>web portal</b> for online retail owners and shoppers</li>
<li>We developed an <b>integral platform</b> working with Ethereum, Shopify, Magento and WooCommerce APIs</li>
<li>We enabled the customers to save money and <b>get the discount coupons in ANY shop</b>, and <b>apply these coupons in ANY shop</b> of the network</li>
<li>Using the blockchain technology ensures the <b>safety and anonymity of user’s personal data</b></li>
<li>The shop owners gain a <b>powerful analytics tool</b>, enabling them to track the usage of their coupons across the network. This allows to adjust their offers to maximize the user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of <b>cross-sales and up-sales grew by 75%</b>, as the customers are incentivized to save money while making useful purchases</p>
