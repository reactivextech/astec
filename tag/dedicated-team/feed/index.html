<!--noteaser-->



<p>Cloud computing is widespread nowadays. Why would any business buy bare metal servers in-house or rent them in dedicated data centers, and have to pay for additional equipment and staff (ventilation, cooling, dehumidification systems, on-site system administrators) — if you can rent some cloud virtual machines and pay only for the resources consumed? Using the cloud helps save money, time and effort — but what is the cloud, anyway?</p>



<p>Generally speaking, the cloud is the way of organizing the computing resources to ensure maximum scalability through virtualization. Where dedicated data centers operate in the terms of virtual servers and racks of bare metal servers, cloud data centers use clusters of virtualized instances, spanning across multiple data centers in various geographical locations.</p>



<p>Why is this better? Let’s take a closer look at how a traditional server-based business operates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_cloud_Building-on-premise_2-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6990"/></figure>



<h2>Building on-premise and dedicated infrastructure</h2>



<p>A company buys several servers and creates a server room on-premises. Even if you need just one server for testing, one for storing code, one for hosting production environment — you will also need to store backups somewhere, run a replica server and a load balancer.</p>



<p>Thus said, you will easily need to buy up to 10 servers for an on-prem infrastructure and maintain them (meaning you will have to also pay for various server equipment and professional maintenance services). What is most inconvenient, one cannot predict the workload of the server, so most of the time some of the server resources remain unused. The cost-efficiency of this approach is very low, as these servers will work 8-10 hours a day and will be idling in the night, during weekends, holidays and vacations — but you will have to pay for them all the same.</p>



<p>The variant most of the businesses used to go was renting these servers from dedicated hosting providers who, in their turn, rented these from dedicated data centers. This helped greatly cut on the maintenance costs, yet the performance issues remained — the remote servers still used electricity while running idle most of the time, and shutting them down for the weekend was clearly not an option. In addition, these servers still were not running at full capacity most of the time.</p>



<p>Therefore, the following issues limit the efficiency of bare metal server architecture:</p>



<ul><li>to ensure stable operations, you must have a replica of every server, essentially doubling the CAPEX</li><li>you can never load the bare metal servers to full, so some amount of resources is always idling, bloating your OPEX with no real benefits for your business</li><li>even some of the resources you use can be idle 12-16 hours a day, on weekends, holidays and vacations, etc.</li><li>it takes quite long to provision new servers and configure them, be it in-house or remotely</li><li>remote servers have good latency for their neighboring location and can lag for some areas across the globe, based on the uplink.</li></ul>



<p>These limitations have led to the introduction of various virtualization systems and the introduction of virtual machines. Thus said, a bare metal server resources can be sliced into multiple smaller parts and many virtual servers can run atop a single piece of hardware. This has dramatically increased the resource-efficiency of hosting, yet the volume of resources required to run the virtualization systems themselves was still quite high.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_cloud_Cloud-computing-introduction_3-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6989"/></figure>



<h2>Cloud computing introduction</h2>



<p>However, the virtualization of resources helped change the pattern of thinking and remove the limitations of allocating the resources within the boundaries of the physical capacities of the servers. It also helped solve another important problem — overspending on unused resources. The reason for this is that the customers don’t rent the cloud servers 24/7, they rent certain amounts of resources for some periods of time.</p>



<p>The cloud computing provider purchases the hardware equipment (server boxes, racks, commutators, etc.) en masse and fills their data centers with resources for rent. The customers purchase cloud instances — not the actual hardware, but the guarantee that certain quotas of computing resources (disk space, I/O, bandwidth, CPU time, RAM power) will be available to them upon request.</p>



<p>None of the cloud customers actually owns any computing resources — they rent them for some time, and when these resources are not needed — they are allocated to another customer. This is the basis of high-availability and scalability — every customer uses the resources only for the time needed and pays only for the resources actually spent. This is called Pay-As-Yo-Go or PAYG billing model.</p>



<p>Such an approach helped solve all the issues of the dedicated server infrastructure:</p>



<ul><li>you buy exactly the number of resources you need</li><li>you pay only for the resources you actually use</li><li>if you need more resources — they are provisioned instantly</li><li>when the cloud computing resources are not used, they are returned back to the cloud provider’s pool and are used by other customers</li><li>cloud virtualization architecture allows combining the resources of the whole datacenters and geographical regions into so-called Availability Zones</li><li>your products or services can be easily transferred between AZ’s to ensure minimal latency to for the majority of your customers at any point in time, or can span across several AZ’s, should the need be</li></ul>



<p>Thus said, cloud computing infrastructure is much more cost-efficient, can be scaled up and down quickly, is quickly configured and equally well accessible across the globe. These benefits are the reason the majority of startups, small-to-medium enterprises and global corporations are already using cloud computing services or are in the process of transition to the cloud.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="220" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_cloud_list1_4-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6988"/></figure>



<h2>Types of the cloud</h2>



<p>A business can utilize one or several of the cloud computing models:</p>



<ul><li><b>Public cloud</b>. The most popular cloud computing approach, provided by cloud vendors like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean, etc. It works exactly as described above, with each customer getting a little piece of the common pie under the same privileges. Most of the apps and websites you use are hosted in a public cloud.</li><li><b>Private cloud</b>. This can either be a segment of a public cloud provisioned to a single customer or an on-prem cloud solution like OpenShift or OpenStack. It is provisioned for a single customer and cannot be accessible by anyone from the outside. This type of security is highly valued by the banks, financial organizations, scientific or governmental organizations.</li><li><b>Hybrid cloud</b>. This is a combination of the previous two models, where the sensitive data is securely stored on-prem or in a private cloud, while the customer-facing systems are deployed to the public cloud, like CloudFlare or CloudFront CDN, for maximum scalability and security.</li><li><b>Multi-cloud</b>. This is a powerful tool for skilled DevOps engineers, an approach of building modular systems with interchangeable components, so that Google cloud services can be relatively quickly replaced with Amazon Web Services infrastructure, etc. This can be very useful for building complex infrastructures for workload-intensive projects but requires top-notch configuration to be efficient.</li></ul>



<p>Thus said, regardless of the cloud computing model you choose, there also is a question of the cloud layer to consider.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="182" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_cloud_list2_5-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6987"/></figure>



<h2>Cloud computing layers</h2>



<p>There are three commonly depicted layers of cloud computing:</p>



<ul><li><b>Infrastructure-as-a-Service or IaaS</b>. This layer covers the use of virtual machines, operating systems, libraries, networking, DNS, load balancers, etc. This is the layer where the DevOps engineers from the cloud platform, IT service provider or your IT department work when they provision, configure and manage the infrastructure. This level grants the most capabilities but requires the most expertise to run properly.</li><li><b>Platform-as-a-Service or PaaS</b>. This layer is used by developers and system administrators who just use the platform services to deliver new code or manage the existing infrastructure without actually looking under the hood. Google App Engine, AWS Lamba serverless computing, AWS CI/CD Pipeline are examples of PaaS. The customers can configure these services through the dashboard and have limited control over rebooting them but must operate within the preset parameters and limits.</li><li><b>Software-as-a-Service or SaaS</b>. This layer of the cloud computing covers pretty much all software and web apps currently in use, like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Viber, Snapchat — all of these are delivered under the SaaS model. The customer has minimal control over the software configuration, available through in-app settings only.</li></ul>



<p>Some people think that this is a progression from “most server management” to “least server management” and they are partially right. However, the pinnacle, in this case, should be serverless computing — a service from AWS, GCP or MS Azure, where the customers never get to manage the servers at all. They just upload the code to the AWS Lambda or Google Functions and configure when it should be run — the cloud vendor does the rest. This is useful for functions that run irregularly, for short periods of time and/or require large resources, which makes renting standard cloud instances inappropriate. However, the users must understand the specifics of the serverless functions they are going to use and they must be able to configure them correctly. Thus said, AWS Lambda and its analogs are actually PaaS tools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="220" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_cloud_list3_6-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6986"/></figure>



<h2>DevOps services for managed cloud computing</h2>



<p>We have mentioned several times already that quite a deep DevOps expertise is required to provision, configure and manage the cloud computing cost-effectively. Where to find such a skill set? A business might go for one of three main approaches:</p>



<ul><li><b>Find and hire a DevOps talent in-house</b>. This approach seems the best for many businesses, but it actually isn’t. Hiring such a specialist has all the risks of any other recruitment process, and there are no highly skilled DevOps engineers on the market (see the reason below). You can try to use the cloud yourself based on the extensive knowledgebase every platform offers, but mastering it without previous experience will take too much of your valuable time.</li><li><b>Hire specialists from the cloud service provider</b>. Every cloud platform has a huge staff of talented DevOps specialists that can help you build and run any infrastructure you need. However, these specialists know their vendor-specific features and tools best and will try to use them wherever possible, which can result in vendor lock-in. The only way to avoid it is by designing the cloud infrastructure yourself, which is, once again, hard if you don’t have the expertise at hand.</li><li><b>Hiring a team from a Managed Service Provider</b>. There are IT outsourcing companies that provide managed DevOps services. This is the most cost-effective approach to cloud management, as these companies house top-notch DevOps talents, who are drawn in by the rich variety of projects and the ability to learn the latest technology and best practices quickly.</li></ul>



<p>Thus said, such teams provide affordable IT services, have lots of ready solutions for typical issues and can begin working on your project from day one. The only question is how to find a reliable Managed Service Provider? Obviously, the team you want to work with should be experienced, have positive reviews from their previous customers, be leaders of international business ratings, etc.</p>



<p>Most importantly, they must be willing and able to provide the services you seek, on time and under budget. Should you find such a company — you will be able to use cloud computing to the fullest extent. Good luck with this endeavor!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/what-is-the-cloud-cloud-computing/">What is the Cloud & Cloud Computing</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><span id="more-5482"></span></p>
<p>What does an average German business know about Ukraine? Let’s list several interesting facts, some of which were previously mentioned in our list of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/20-reasons-order-outsourcing-services-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 reasons to outsource to Ukraine</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe with about 40 million population</li>
<li>Main exports of Ukraine are metallurgical produce, agricultural produce, and IT services</li>
<li>There are more than 160,000 IT specialists in Ukraine, making it the 4th largest IT pool in Europe¹.</li>
<li>Ukrainian IT outsourcing sector grows at GAGR ~30% a year, bringing in about $5 bn in revenues in 2017</li>
<li>Over 80% of IT talents in Ukraine speak fluent or Upper intermediate English, which simplifies communication. There are also no cultural barriers.</li>
<li>The core of IT talents in Ukraine is composed of Senior and Middle-level developers, DevOps engineers, Big Data architects, etc. At the same time, there are lots of aspiring Junior-level specialists, who gain experience quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3935" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/distribution-developers-ukraine.jpg" alt="Distribution of Junior, Middle and Senior developers in Ukraine" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<ul style="float: left;">
<li>There are more than 100 R&amp;D centers of global enterprises like Samsung Electronics, Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Ericson, Boeing, Wargaming, Skype, eBay, and Magento in Ukraine.</li>
<li>Time zones are overlapping, so <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/5-benefits-dedicated-team-developers-vs-house-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukrainian dedicated team</a> will be available during your whole business hours.</li>
<li>Ukraine was named the #1 IT outsourcing destination in 2017 by GSA UK².</li>
<li>According to the International Bureau³, there are numerous successful cooperation projects between Germany and Ukraine in the fields of scientifical research, economic management, healthcare and biology, technology and IT innovation.</li>
<li>Should you need to kickstart the project at your location, the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/dedicated-team-2-hours-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated team from Ukraine can reach you in merely 2 hours</a>! Since 2017, there are multiple direct flights between Ukraine and Germany. We are well-acquainted with the client’s wishes and our teams are ready to go on a business trip to your location on request.</li>
<li>While working with a dedicated team from Ukraine a German business can save considerable sums of money. We can hire and onboard the required talents much faster and don’t have to deal with the official German bureaucracy while doing this. Thus said, hiring a team in Ukraine allows <b>saving up to 30% on project costs</b>, as compared to hiring it in Germany — and this takes care of the GDPR from the start.<br />
To say more, there are at least 55,000 open IT vacancies on the German job market, according to Bitkom reports⁴. This means German businesses do not have readily available high-quality teams at their fingertips. Quite the contrary, Ukrainian IT services providers are listed among top 10 Bloomberg, Gartner⁵, StackOverflow⁶ ratings, meaning they have teams ready to start working on the project at once.</li>
</ul>
<h2>IT Svit collaboration — a great choice for your business</h2>
<p>General facts aside, why would a German startup like to work with a dedicated team from IT Svit?</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the course of company history, we had multiple German partners. We know the main challenges the German businesses often face: legacy infrastructure, lack of DevOps engineers, cloud architects, and senior-level developers.</li>
<li>We have a large pool of pre-vetted candidates able to cover the needs of almost any project at once. Our in-house team is able to fill almost all the roles with ease, and we have a strong process of internal training to grow the team skill level. When we have to expand the team, we do the screening and testing ourselves and present the German partners with the best candidates to pick.</li>
<li>When the team is composed we arrange a business trip to the customer’s location (Hamburg, Dusseldorf, Berlin or another city) to establish personal contact and work out communication and workflows. Quite often, customers prefer to visit our Kharkiv office and work with the team on the project onboarding here.</li>
<li>As <b>90% of our customers are startups</b>, we are accustomed to launching the project rapidly and adding new team members on the go to minimize the time-to-market for your products.</li>
<li>We understand the importance of references and we are proud to provide the unbiased Clutch review⁷ from our long-standing German partner, <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/cloud-cms-showcase-setup-devops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skillbyte</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some fun facts about Ukraine, so you know your visit here will be pleasant and productive!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ukrainians love beer</b> just as Germans do. In 2018, more than 163,000 tourists from Ukraine visited Germany, and at least 85,000 of them attended the Oktoberfest⁸. Many German fans appraised Ukrainian beer during the Euro 2012 championship.</li>
<li><b>We love football too</b>, and there are several Ukrainians in the Bundesliga.</li>
<li><b>Ukrainian cuisine</b> is rich in tastes and flavors and highly praised by tourists worldwide, including Germans. Should you go for a project onboarding visit to Ukraine, you will most likely be quite satisfied with local food and beverages.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The very first question to ask yourself before contacting the IT outsourcing company is “what billing model is the best for my project?” We list the pros and cons of 3 main IT outsourcing models.</p>
<p><span id="more-4721"></span></p>
<p>While many sources erroneously name these approaches “the software development pricing models”, their application is not limited to software development only. A Managed Services Provider can use the Fixed price, Time-and-materials or Dedicated Team pricing models for any type of services they deliver, be it software development, cloud infrastructure management, or legacy infrastructure optimization and transition to the cloud, etc.</p>
<p>Thus said, we take a closer look at all of these pricing models to define their proc, cons and use cases.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" id="fixed" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4723" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_3_IT_outsourcing_models_2.jpg" alt="Fixed price contracts" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<h2>Fixed price contracts</h2>
<p>This IT outsourcing pricing model works best when used for projects with a predefined scope of tasks, rigid requirements and predictable time frames. This model requires the customer to provide a detailed list of project requirements and all required developer documentation, so the contractors can design a Scope of Work and work according to a strict roadmap with unchangeable deadlines.</p>
<p><b>Pros of fixed-price</b> IT outsourcing model:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Clarity.</b> All project requirements are specified beforehand, as well as all the required developer documentation</li>
<li><b>Precision.</b> The project scope and time frames are known in advance, so the team can set the deadlines and monitor the project progress with ease.</li>
<li><b>Accountability.</b> A reliable contractor will accomplish the project on time and under budget, even if it means some extra hours for the team.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons of fixed-price</b> IT outsourcing approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Risks.</b> Risks are higher for the outsourcing team, as the project scope is rigid and cannot be altered. Any force-majeure situation affecting the scope or the price of the project leads to the need of complete project reevaluation.</li>
<li><b>Diligence.</b> Fixed price projects require diligent planning, either from the customer or from the contractor. If the contractor does the estimates, this might take up to 40% of the budget and time invested in the project as a whole.</li>
<li><b>Meticulousness.</b> A dedicated Project Manager is needed either on the customer’s or on the contractor’s side to ensure all the tasks are done according to deadlines. Otherwise, there is a high risk of the team dropping certain features to meet the deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Use cases for the fixed price contracts</b> are either smaller pilot projects like a website redesign or a long-term partnership with the strictly limited scope of responsibilities (customer/technical support).</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" id="time" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4724" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_3_IT_outsourcing_models_3.jpg" alt="Time-and-materials IT outsourcing model" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<h2>Time-and-materials IT outsourcing model</h2>
<p>This is a more flexible approach to IT outsourcing, as the customer pays in smaller chunks for work accomplished during the billable hours. To say more, this pay-as-you-go model allows to pay only for the work actually done (features delivered, milestones met), and not for the time the team spent drinking coffee, smoking or surfing Facebook. Thus said, the time-and-materials model is more suited to longer-term projects, where the final requirements are not known in advance and can be changed on the go.</p>
<p><b>Pros of time-and-materials</b> IT outsourcing approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Flexibility.</b> The customer can change the project scope, requirements or team size on the go to meet his business goals.</li>
<li><b>Transparency.</b> The customer has in-depth control over the budget and pays only for the results actually delivered.</li>
<li><b>Efficiency.</b> This is the best model for Agile/Scrum software delivery process, where short sprints result in delivering tangible results.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons of time-and-materials</b> IT outsourcing model:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vagueness.</b> Both the project budget and time frames remain undefined, so it’s hard to predict when the product will be delivered or how much it will cost.</li>
<li><b>Supervision.</b> A detailed supervision is required to ensure the team estimates the tasks correctly and accomplishes the milestones in full.</li>
<li><b>Communication.</b> Time-consuming communication is required to clarify any updated project requirements or collect feedback on the features delivered. However, this is more of a benefit, as it ensures the final project meets your expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Use cases for time-and-materials contracts</b> include product development (MVP development, etc.) or product updates (adding new features or rebuilding the product with RESTful APIs).</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" id="dedicated" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4725" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_3_IT_outsourcing_models_3-Copy.jpg" alt="Dedicated team IT outsourcing model " width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<h2>Dedicated team IT outsourcing model</h2>
<p>This approach combines the features of both previous models but is slightly better than both of them. It is used to compensate for the lack of in-house IT expertise on mid-to-long-term projects. The contractor builds the team according to the customer’s requirements, and this team can report directly to the customer, or be supervised by a dedicated Project Manager. The expenses are comprised of the salaries of the team members + a contractor’s fee for administrative needs (workplace expenses, etc.)</p>
<p><b>Pros of the dedicated team</b> approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Predictability.</b> The bills are formed on a predictable and transparent basis and the customer always pays only for the results delivered.</li>
<li><b>Adjustability.</b> The team size, project scope or requirements — anything can be adjusted if need be.</li>
<li><b>Continuity.</b> The team works on your project for a long time, so it has a full understanding of all project features and is dedicated to running the project smoothly.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons of the dedicated team</b> approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Graduality.</b> If the team cannot be composed of the available contractor’s staff, finding additional talents can take some time (2-4 weeks on average, based on the skills required). Thus said, the core of the team can start working at once, while the rest of the members will be added gradually.</li>
<li><b>Thoroughness.</b> Unless a customer prefers to pay for the personal Project Manager, who will take care of the routine team management tasks, working with a dedicated model requires a thorough control of all tasks to ensure the project moves in the desired direction.</li>
<li><b>Indistinctness.</b> When there are no clear project requirements, the final result can differ much from the picture the customer expected. However, in the case of working with experienced teams, this situation is largely due to the fact they remove all bottlenecks and vulnerabilities the customer did not even think about.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Use cases for dedicated team model</b> include long-term large-scope projects with evolving requirements, like the transition to the cloud from the legacy infrastructure, implementation of the AI/ML algorithms for Big Data analytics or cloud consultancy to increase IT infrastructure performance.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6655" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="447" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image.jpg 1200w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-300x112.jpg 300w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-768x286.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image-1024x381.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h2 id="final">Final thoughts on 3 IT outsourcing models</h2>
<p>Thus said, every IT project provides the best results when it is managed according to the most suitable IT outsourcing model. There are situations, however, when short-time projects are best done by a dedicated team (like an MVP development to join the startup accelerator), or when the project with rigid requirements is best accomplished under the time-and-materials approach.</p>
<p>Therefore, the decision of the most appropriate IT outsourcing model is best made after a consultation with the Managed Service Provider which will handle it. Once the contractor of your choice knows the scope of the project, the skills required for it and the expected budget, they will be able to suggest the approach that fits it best. Will it be Fixed Price, Time-and-Materials or <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-dedicated-teams-of" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dedicated Team</a> — is up to the business to decide!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/3-outsourcing-models-fixed-price-vs-time-materials-vs-dedicated-teams/">3 IT outsourcing models: Fixed Price vs Time-and-Materials vs Dedicated Teams</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dedicated teams are the backbone of modern outsourced IT operations, but there are certain risks when working with them. Several risk management approaches exist to deal with the issue.</p>
<p><span id="more-4694"></span></p>
<p>Risk management is the essential part of normal business operations. Every entrepreneur wants to ensure their ROI will be maximal and the business endeavors will succeed. Therefore, a clear understanding of risks and the ways to mitigate them is needed, along with the diligent monitoring of the operations for the first signs of approaching the crisis. This is especially important to maximize the <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-dedicated-teams-of" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">advantages of dedicated teams</a>, as the projects they partake in are often crucial for the business success, so minimizing the risks across the board is vital.</p>
<div id="most">There are several most widespread risks when working with dedicated teams:</div>
<ol>
<li><b>Exceeding the planned deadlines and budgets.</b> This is the most commonplace risk, as there are numerous factors that influence the longevity and cost of software development.</li>
<li><b>Gradual loss of team productivity.</b> People get tired of doing the same task over time, so a periodical change of targets is recommended. In short, it’s better to develop 10 features a year by completing one at a time, than stretching the development of 10 features in a bundle to a year.</li>
<li><b>Developing the wrong product features and/or UI.</b> Miscommunications and changes in requirements mid-development often lead to the final product being different in the way it looks and works from what was expected initially.</li>
<li><b>Gold plating of the projects.</b> This is another commonplace issue when the developers or the customer have bright ideas on how to improve the product even further during the development, thus exceeding the project scale.</li>
<li><b>Changing the requirements frequently.</b> This risk cannot be mitigated by the dedicated team. The customer himself must be sure of what he wants to receive as a result and not change the project requirements mid-development.</li>
<li><b>Lack of declared skills or expertise.</b> The team member might take a sick leave, a maternity leave or quit the team altogether. This might put the corresponding aspect of the project on halt until a replacement is found. The way to deal with this risk is ensuring your dedicated team has 2 specialists of each profile available to minimize the risk of stalling your project. This, of course, is possible only when working with a <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/msp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reputable Managed Services Provider</a>, able to scale the teams upon request.</li>
<li><b>A lengthy process of screening/shortlisting/onboarding for the team members.</b> This risk is also always present due to the instability of the recruitment processes. Once again, working with one of the <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/ukraine/leaders-matrix" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">leaders of the IT outsourcing market</a> can ensure the needed talents are either readily available or can be enlisted quickly.</li>
<li><b>Lack of mutual trust, different corporate cultures, different time zones.</b> The best way to gain trust in your dedicated team before even contacting them is checking for unbiased <a href="https://clutch.co/profile/it-svit#reviews" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">customer reviews</a> on platforms like Clutch, Upwork or GoodFirms. This initial trust can later grow after shortlisting and interviewing the company, thus planting the basis for a strong long-term partnership. As for the cultural and time zone differences, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/20-reasons-order-outsourcing-services-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">outsourcing to Ukraine</a> or other Eastern European countries allows solving these issues with ease.</li>
</ol>
<p>These risks are always present, regardless of the professional level of the contractor you work with. Therefore, the goal of the risk management is evaluating these risks precisely and mitigating them according to one or more of preferred strategies.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" id="strategy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4696" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Risk_Management_Dedicated_2.jpg" alt="Risk Management Strategies" width="1200" height="457" /></p>
<h2>Risk Management Strategies</h2>
<p>We provide a brief explanation of the most widely used risk management strategies and best practices.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>DTRM concept.</b> The Dedicated Team Risk Management concept emphasizes the importance of regular assessments of the situation to mitigate the risks, surrounding the software development process. Both the customer and the contractor’s dedicated team form the list of the risks likely to affect the project and monitor the situation regularly for the signs of these occurrences. If the periodic progress assessments show the signs of any risk surfacing, the team and the customer discuss and adopt the best way to avoid it.</li>
<li><b>EBIOS.</b> This is a French methodology for risk assessment when developing and maintaining the distributed infrastructure systems, concentrating on the security of operations. It is split into 5 stages:<br />
— system context study, including the audit of the existing infrastructure,<br />
— forming the security requirements checklist to ensure all the needs are met<br />
— ongoing threats study to analyze the working conditions of the system<br />
— identification of security objectives to allow choosing the best approach to meeting them<br />
— determination of security requirements to account for the changes required to improve the system security<br />
Applying this methodology provides traceability and transparency of ongoing system updates and DevOps workflows.</li>
<li><b>ProRisk Framework.</b> This is an open framework for risk assessment with multiple ready templates, that can be configured to fit any project scale and requirements. Despite the slightly steep learning curve, this method is suitable for medium and large scale software delivery projects.</li>
<li><b>RiskIT method.</b> This is a comprehensive method for risk management in IT projects.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4697" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Risk_Management_Dedicated_3.jpg" alt="RiskIT Method" width="1200" height="720" />
<p>This approach helps all the project stakeholders to take part in the ongoing assessment and control of the project workflows, enabling them to react to the changes in the situation at once.</li>
<li><b>GDSD Risk management model.</b> This is the risk management model for Geographically Distributed Software Development project. Oftentimes, the success of the project depends heavily on timely completion of various sub-projects, as well as on participants executing their roles diligently. Thus said, the most common approach to risk mitigation (especially in the case of IT Svit remote project management) is leaving it all to the Project Manager, who periodically assesses the progress of all tasks in the sub-projects and the main project, to make sure all the participants are going to meet the deadlines.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4698" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Risk_Management_Dedicated_4.jpg" alt="GDSD Risk management model" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>As you can see, there are quite a few risk management and mitigation approaches. The main point here is the need to assess the project progress adequately, communicate frequently and openly, as well as be willing to collaborate to ensure the project success.</p>
<h2 id="final">Final thoughts on risk management for dedicated teams</h2>
<p>The best way to mitigate the risks in remote software development is through frequent communication and collaboration between the customer and the contactor’s dedicated team. When the customer understands that making changes to the project specifications mid-development can render all the previous work useless — the risk of this event is significantly lower.</p>
<p>Based on IT Svit experience, the rest of the dedicated team project risks can be easily mitigated by adding 20% to the development estimates. This ensures there is sufficient time to deal with the majority of issues. This approach is justified by multiple 5-star IT Svit customer reviews on Clutch, which show our professionalism and praise the efficiency of our project management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the modern business world outsourcing is a great way to enhance your team with needed skills fast. Sometimes, the team you need is literally 2 hours away!</p>
<p><span id="more-4387"></span></p>
<p>European business has to deal with multiple legal regulations and financial limitations. For one, the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/gdpr-can-ruin-trampoline-business/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GDPR</a> makes keeping the customer data secure a resource-consuming process. To add more, the funding is not as abundant as in America and securing the investment can be a daunting perspective. Lastly, the funds secured should be spent optimally, meaning the businesses have to find the best service for the least money.</p>
<p>Consulting software development to South-Eastern Asia is no longer the solution, as these teams have proven unreliable time and again. There are at least <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/20-reasons-order-outsourcing-services-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">20 reasons to outsource to Eastern Europe</a> and Ukraine in particular. Since November 2018, there is one more — WizzAir opens direct flights to Kiev, Kharkiv and Dnipro from London, Stockholm and Berlin. Therefore, any business can get to their dedicated team and discuss the project progress in person in around 2 hours!</p>
<div id="benefits">Why is such a route preferable?</div>
<ol>
<li><b>High level of skill</b>. Ukrainian software developers have proven their worth over the last decade. More than 100 R&amp;D centers from world-leading brands like Samsung, Microsoft, Procter&amp;Gamble and other companies are situated in Ukraine. Multiple Ukrainian companies are listed near the top of the list of <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/msp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">best Managed Services Providers worldwide</a>, and some of the <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/ukraine/leaders-matrix" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">leaders of IT outsourcing market in Ukraine</a> make it to the top of Gartner’s, Forrester’s and other ratings for several years now.</li>
<li><b>Cultural and language fit</b>. Ukrainians share the values of the Western countries. We have the same approach to doing business — on time and responsibly is the way we work. Our holiday calendars mostly match, meaning the team is always at hand when you need them. Most of Ukrainian IT specialists have Upper Intermediate or fluent English, so miscommunication is not an issue.</li>
<li><b>Same Timezone</b>. Kievan time is UTC +2, meaning the business hours of Western European customers mostly coincide with their Eastern European contractors.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" id="choose" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4388" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dedciated-team-benefits.jpg" alt="Dedicated team benefits" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>Kharkiv-based IT Svit company is one of the possible destinations for such a partnership. Why choose us?</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Diverse and highly skilled team</b>. We house 50+ software engineers who are apt at multiple fields:<br />
&#8211; <b>DеvOps expertise</b> (cloud transition, IT infrastructure optimization, system performance audit)<br />
&#8211; <b>Big Data services</b> (design and implementation of bespoke Big Data solutions, setup of AWS, GCP, Azure features)<br />
&#8211; <b>AI &amp; Machine Learning</b> (selecting, training and implementing appropriate AI models for various business tasks)<br />
&#8211; <b>Full-stack software development</b> (from PHP and Laravel to React.JS, Java, Python and Vue.JS) — we can design and develop any type of product<br />
&#8211; <b>Blockchain development</b> (design and full-scale development of crypto exchanges and other apps)<br />
&#8211; <b>QA, testing, system administration</b> (manual and automated testing and QA, Windows and *nix system administration)</li>
<li><b>Commute proximity</b>. Kharkiv has a well-developed infrastructure with multiple transportation options including the subway. You can reach any address in Kharkiv in under 40 minutes, and most of hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues are located close to the center. The IT community is mostly concentrated in the “Kharkiv Silicon Valley” — near the “Botanichny Sad” subway station.</li>
<li><b>Cost-effectiveness</b>. While most of the international corporations have their offices at Kyiv, hiring Kharkiv IT specialists is much more affordable, as the salaries here are lower than at Kyiv and much lower than in Europe, with the same level of quality. This makes outsourcing to Kharkiv more feasible and economical for businesses.</li>
<li><b>Flat company structure</b>. IT Svit has rich experience dealing with various types of projects and we understand the importance of direct communication for the success of the software development. The customer can have direct access to any team member or manager to discuss any aspect of the project and clarify all the important points.</li>
<li><b>We can go to your location</b>. Many customers prefer the onboarding to take place at their location. We are ready to comply in order to get your team acquainted with our specialists, establish the workflows and hone the communication. This approach helps secure a solid ground for further fruitful long-term partnership.</li>
<li><b>We go an extra mile</b>. Many IT Svit customer reviews emphasize the fact that we suggest the project improvements that were overlooked during the planning stage or became obvious during the development. This way, we remove the possible bottlenecks before they become an issue, saving our customer’s money and our operational overhead.</li>
</ol>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The need to hire a dedicated team of developers is one of the biggest challenges for a startup early in its lifecycle. Asking for recommendations from your friends, googling, searching on freelancer sites, searching through social media and LinkedIn, reaching out for MSPs or attending local meetups and hackathons… the choice is up to you, we simply highlight the pros and cons of each approach to hiring a professional software development team.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/hire-dedicated-team-developers-startup/">How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most important part of a successful startup launch is creating a neat and efficient MVP. The main question one has to answer is how to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup?</p>
<p><span id="more-3033"></span></p>
<p>As the startup lifecycle involves investing significant time and resources into developing an MVP, the startups want guarantees of a successful and timely project completion. Hiring a dedicated team of software developers is the basis of a successful product delivery.In a perfect scenario, you already have a dedicated team of software developers who helped you accomplish a bunch of projects and who understand your requirements and expectations. In the real world, you do not have them and have to hire a dedicated development team to turn your project into reality. There are such possible courses of actions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Searching for a dedicated team of developers by recommendation</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Searching for a professional development team on the Internet</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Hiring a software development team through freelancer workplaces</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Contacting a team of software engineers over the social media or LinkedIn</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Hiring a dedicated team for software development from a Managed Services Provider</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Meeting a team of software developers on conferences, meetups, and hackathons</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of these approaches.</p>
<h2>Choosing a dedicated team of developers by a word of mouth</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3041" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_word-of-mouth.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_1" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>The word of mouth and the personal advocacy is the best promotion for any services, including the software development. Some of your relatives, friends or colleagues have definitely used the help of some developers to create a website, launch a web app or deploy a business analytics solution, and can introduce them to you.</p>
<p>However, the important thing to keep in mind is that the technology stack differs much from the mobile app and web development, building a payment gateway or delivering a business analytics solution. Thus said, even if the dedicated software development team in question was able to deliver a great service to your friend, they might not be able to do the same for you… yet they can introduce you to the one who can. Here at IT Svit, we know this is quite an efficient approach, as around 70% of our customers are referred to us by our previous clients and partners.</p>
<h2>Browsing the Internet to hire a dedicated team of developers</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3038" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_Internet.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_3" width="120" height="120" />Many long-standing software development teams offer their services through their landing pages over the Internet. As creation and promotion of websites offering various software development and delivery services require lots of time and effort, the companies who do this should be serious about their jobs. To say even more, if these websites appear on the top SERPs, the teams behind them must be doing their job well.</p>
<p>Try searching for the keywords relevant to your project, like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Dedicated web development services</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Custom-tailored cloud solutions for startups and business</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Building an MVP for startups</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Full-cycle services for startups, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The keywords in your search requests will be related to your project, obviously. The resulting pages will provide the contacts of multiple software development teams or their contacts on industry-specific classified advertisement websites and boards. This might even bring up the reviews from the previous customers of said teams placed on such boards.</p>
<h2>Hiring a freelance team of developers</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3037 alignleft" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_freelance.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_4" width="120" height="120" />Websites like <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/companies/~014d4727e2f42f3042" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Upwork</a> or Freelancer are quite popular freelancer workplaces, where multiple software development teams offer their services. These services vary from web development and mobile app development for iOS and Android to creating custom CRM or corporate eLearning systems, delivering various infrastructure solutions or providing custom development of modules for popular eCommerce platforms.</p>
<p>Trying to hire a reliable team of developers on these websites grants the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Multiple filters allow specifying the search parameters precisely</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Team descriptions hold in-depth details of their experience and the technology stack they use</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">The rating system helps evaluate the reliability of any development team</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">The reviews from other customers help form a holistic view of the team’s performance</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">You can publish a job offer and the team will contact you on their own</li>
</ul>
<p>The drawbacks of this approach include the need to decline multiple job requests from India and the chance of your job offer being reposted under another title and for a lower price, to be given to a subcontractor. Such middlemen spoil the hiring process and you risk getting a subpar quality product that will be delivered overdue.</p>
<p>In addition, God forbid you from trying to form a dedicated team of freelancers yourself to manage the project completion. This is a risky and effort-consuming endeavor highly prone to failure.</p>
<h2>Contacting a dedicated software development team in the social media and on LinkedIn</h2>
<p>One of the most obvious ways to reach out to the software development teams is contacting them through the social media like Facebook and LinkedIn. These resources have thematic groups where these developers can be found. You can post your project description there and ask for help, contacts of the worthy contractors or at least a repost. Your friends and family can do this too — sharing is caring, you know.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3039" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_LinkedIn.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup on LinkedIn" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>The main benefit of searching via LinkedIn is that this social network is built to connect professionals. The specialists post their portfolios there, specify their skills, and the level of their endorsements shows their overall efficiency at their job — or great soft skills <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> To say even more, many managed services providers maintain their presence on LinkedIn and can be contacted through there. Just search for the keywords relevant to your requirements and select Companies filter to get the list of potential contractors. Browse through the results, assess the companies and contact the CEO or CTO of the most promising contractor!</p>
<h2>Hiring a dedicated team of developers from an MSP</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3040" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_MSP.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_2" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Using all the aforementioned methods of searching for a reliable team of developers you will often see the contacts of Managed Services Provider companies (MSPs). These firms specialize in the development of any kind of software and apps and their ongoing support. You might happen to notice the same companies on the Internet, mentioned by your acquaintances, listed on various work marketplaces, business ads boards and on the social media.</p>
<p>By analyzing the search results you can make the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">If the company website appears on the 1-2 Google result page on the searches relevant to your project, the company has invested heavily in the correct SEO promotion.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">If the website appears for many keywords, the company has built the right marketing and SEO strategy — and will be able to do this for your startup as well.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">If the company website has a sleek and nice-looking website with intuitive design, easy navigation and fast performance, the products of this company will likely have the same features.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">If the company website contains sufficient quantities of completed business cases and finished projects, along with a positive feedback from satisfied customers, the company really possesses a good stack of skills and experience, allowing it to complete your project on time and with reliable quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same goes the other way. If the company website looks untidy, has complex navigation and malfunctioning buttons on various pages, it’s better to avoid dealing with such a company for good. Otherwise, you risk receiving the same flaws for the product they develop for you. In addition, aside from reading the positive feedback on the website, try searching for additional reviews and feedback over the Internet. Negative reviews help form a holistic picture of the company, don’t they?</p>
<h2>Meeting a dedicated team of software developers at conferences, meetups, and hackathons</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3035" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_conference.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_6" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>In order to remain competitive, the software developers should always continue their self-education and professional growth. This is why good software development teams often participate in various conferences, meetups, and hackathons, which are well-covered in the mass media and social media. Attend such events in your city — or neighboring IT hubs. Talk with the participants, and they will either be able to help you or will point you in the right direction. To say even more, you will be able to see the efficiency of the team’s work on the hackathon.</p>
<p>The drawbacks of this approach are the same as with the word of mouth recommendations. You might find a great dedicated team of software developers that just does not have the needed skills to make your project a reality.</p>
<h2>How to evaluate a dedicated software development team then?</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3036" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_evaluation.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_5" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>We recommend combining all the aforementioned approaches. You will obviously not hire the first team you find, as the software development lifecycle of your product will cost several dozen thousand dollars, and you need to hire the most reliable team of developers to invest the money right. Shortlist 3-4 software development teams, evaluate their skill stacks, portfolio, website quality and positioning, feedback from their previous customers.</p>
<p>Note the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Company experience</b>. We do not recommend delegating complex or costly projects to young teams with less than 2-3 years of experience. Such teams either lack the needed experience or might fall apart amidst your project, leaving it in debris.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Staff size</b>. The teams with 10 members or less are usually highly-specialized. This means there is nobody to replace the crucial team member should he or she become ill or leave altogether. We recommend working with the MSPs who are at least 30-40 men strong to ensure the project continuity and timely completion.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Company portfolio</b>. Contact the previous customers of this company. Find out if they were satisfied with the project management and product development, team interaction and feedback response. The real reviews are the best proof of quality, and if the team has already successfully developed the products for startups — they will be able to provide high-quality services and workflows for you.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Product quality</b>. Ask the company to provide the examples of working products and solutions they developed, or try to use the services of the previous customers. If their products are intuitive, performant and work fast — this software development team really can deliver a high-quality product.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Company website</b>. Ask the third-party specialist to evaluate the chosen team’s website. Aside from a good design, it must be functional, intuitive and well-optimized. If the team cannot do it for their own website — they will hardly be able to provide these qualities for your product.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final thoughts on how to hire a reliable team of developers for a startup on your own</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are quite a few ways to hire a reliable team of developers on your own. You can opt for searching through word of mouth recommendations, exploring the Internet on your own, trying to use the popular freelancer workplaces like Upwork and Freelancer, look on the social media and LinkedIn, go for contracting a Managed Service Provider or reaching out to the participants of various conferences, meetups and hackathons.</p>
<p>We understand the process might seem too daunting and laborious. However, it is obviously better to spend more time to hire a reliable team of software developers for your startup and accomplish the project on time. Otherwise, you risk spending the time and money dealing with an inexperienced or unscrupulous contractor.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hiring a dedicated team of developers is obviously hugely beneficial for any startup, as compared to raising an in-house team. You get instant access to a pool of talents with ample expertise who get your project done on time and under budget. The best part is you do not have to pay them for idle waiting afterward — and if the need for their services does arise in the future, you simply hire them again for another one-time job. However, there are 5 more subtle benefits of hiring a dedicated software development team and we describe them in our next article.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/5-benefits-dedicated-team-developers-vs-house-one/">5 benefits of a dedicated team of developers VS an in-house one</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every startup has to make a choice between hiring a dedicated team of developers vs an in-house one. The former approach provides 5 subtle benefits we want to talk about.</p>
<p><span id="more-2998"></span></p>
<p>We have listed the more self-explanatory <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/hiring-dedicated-software-development-team-vs-building-house/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pros and cons of working with a dedicated software development team vs building one in-house</a> in one of our previous articles. They include the things like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">the <b>far lesser TCO</b> of a dedicated team, as you pay them only when you need them;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>polished workflows</b>, as the Managed Services Provider (MSP) always has some job to do and the team is always busy, keeping their skills sharp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>instant access to a greater talent pool</b>, instead of picking them one by one;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>team easy going along</b>, as work conflicts are quite damaging for the product quality;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">the possibility of <b>rapid replacement</b> of a sick or leaving team member,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">the <b>in-depth developer&#8217;s documentation</b> to ensure service continuity, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today we want to add 5 more subtle, yet not in the least important benefits of hiring a dedicated team of developers.</p>
<h2>Same, nearly same or overlapping time zones</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="auto alignnone wp-image-3002 size-full" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Benefits-of-a-dedicated-team-of-developers-VS-an-in-house-one-ITSvit_3.jpg" alt="5 benefits of a dedicated team of developers VS an in-house one_3" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Let’s assume the startup or business is located in the EU or the US and hires a dedicated software development team from Eastern Europe, like Poland or Ukraine. In that case, the time zones are close or overlap. This means the customer either has the same work hours as the MSP, or benefits from issuing requests in the evening and getting the job done overnight, while he is soundly asleep. To say even more, many MSPs provide 24/7 technical support under the SLA coverage, so the important tasks are dealt with swiftly at all times.</p>
<h2>Various staffing models</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="auto alignnone wp-image-3001 size-full" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Benefits-of-a-dedicated-team-of-developers-VS-an-in-house-one-ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="5 benefits of a dedicated team of developers VS an in-house one_2" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>The MSP can send their whole teams (or the required specialists) to a detached duty to the customer’s office should the need arise to sort the things out hands-on. Such cases can include providing technical backup during the business negotiations, teaching the in-house staff to use the bespoke systems, or any other reason, you name it. The thing is, as the dedicated software development teams from Eastern Europe are usually quite proficient or even fluent in English, such detached duty trips run smoothly, yield great results and cost much less, than keeping a local team idle and on a payroll.</p>
<h2>Collaboration benefits</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="auto alignnone wp-image-3004 size-full" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Benefits-of-a-dedicated-team-of-developers-VS-an-in-house-one-ITSvit_6.jpg" alt="5 benefits of a dedicated team of developers VS an in-house one_6" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Yet another form of partnership, and one of the most important when working with a dedicated team of developers is the permanent collaboration. The customers have access to the project management tools like Jira, Redmine or Trello and can monitor the project progress firsthand, in addition to working in close contact with an assigned Project Manager. This allows keeping an eye on the software delivery pipeline, issuing requests and applying feedback as needed.</p>
<h2>Video conferencing</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="auto alignnone wp-image-3003 size-full" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Benefits-of-a-dedicated-team-of-developers-VS-an-in-house-one-ITSvit_5.jpg" alt="5 benefits of a dedicated team of developers VS an in-house one_5" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>An equally important benefit of a dedicated team of developers is the video conferencing, when the customer can have a meeting with the whole team from the comfort of their flat or office, via the laptop and webcam. You can be in touch with every team member and don’t have to pay the rent for the spacious office needed to provide workplaces for the team. Video conferencing allows managing the projects remotely when it’s most convenient both for you and for the dedicated development team to keep the collaboration efficient.</p>
<h2>Customer’s business trips</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="auto alignnone wp-image-3000 size-full" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Benefits-of-a-dedicated-team-of-developers-VS-an-in-house-one-ITSvit_1.jpg" alt="5 benefits of a dedicated team of developers VS an in-house one_1" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>To say even more, in certain cases the customer can avoid paying the rent at all, as they can simply come to the contractor’s office and meet the team in person, oversee the workflow up close and satisfy any inquiries they might have. It goes without mentioning that such trips also help to accommodate with the partners better, as well as offering the taste of local cuisine, amenities, and sightseeing, should such a wish arise. IT Svit long-term customers come to our office quite often and we are always glad to meet the guests.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on the benefits of a dedicated team of developers VS an in-house one</h2>
<p>To sum it up, hiring a dedicated team of developers allows the startup to greatly save on the software development costs and time to market for their product while enjoying the full transparency of the development process, cultural exchange and real-time communication with the team. At least, this is what it looks like for IT Svit customers.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>While a software development team is a crucial business asset needed to build an MVP and ensure a successful startup scaling to the enterprise, this asset must not always be proprietary. The startup can choose between hiring a dedicated software development team or building an in-house team of developers. Today’s article is about the pros and cons of these two approaches from the startup’s point of view.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/hiring-dedicated-software-development-team-vs-building-house/">Hiring a dedicated software development team VS building it in-house</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing between hiring a dedicated software development team or building it in-house can be a choice between making or breaking a startup. Let’s discuss the pros and cons of each approach!<br />
<span id="more-2991"></span></p>
<p>A team of software developers is the backbone of any technology startup nowadays. It is the crucial business asset required to build an MVP. They also are essential for the ongoing product support and development, as well as for scaling the startup to the enterprise when the time comes.The other side of the coin is the high total cost of ownership (TCO) of such an asset, as employing a sufficiently large team of developers is a time-consuming, costly and laborious process.</p>
<h2>Pros and cons of hiring a dedicated team of software engineers</h2>
<p>This is why many startups opt for hiring a dedicated software development team from a managed services provider (MSP) instead. The benefits of this approach are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Greatly decreased TCO</b> of a dedicated software development team. You pay only for the work hours spent and once the project is completed, the expenses stop;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Structured workflows</b> and ample hands-on experience. The team knows what to do and how to do it, providing transparent monitoring at the same time;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Greater talent pool available at once</b>. MSPs usually have scalable teams with specialists of all kinds that can begin working on your project from the day one;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Established in-team collaboration</b> ensuring correct task delegation and strong team spirit. The team members are used to working with each other, which lowers the risk of workplace conflicts that can be quite damaging for the project;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Rapid replacement</b> is possible if a team member takes a sick leave or quits the job.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Detailed product documentation</b> is provided to ensure quick onboarding of any new specialist to work on the product in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2993" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Software-development-team-VS-building-it-in-house-ITSvit_1.jpg" alt="Hiring a dedicated software development team VS building it in-house_1" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>There are more subtle benefits of hiring a dedicated team of developers, but they will be listed in a separate article. As for the drawbacks of choosing to hire dedicated software developers, there indeed is a couple:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">MSPs can support a broad range of products for a variety of customers, meaning the team’s time might be cramped with other tasks. Thus said, allow for <b>slightly broader estimates</b>, as finishing the product in the shortest time possible might be quite difficult.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Working with a dedicated team of software developers requires <b>a lot of remote control of the process</b>. Be prepared to ask lots of questions aside from the Project Manager’s reports. This is your product, after all, and you should keep a close eye on its development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, hiring a dedicated team of software developers can be a huge benefit for a startup. They will get the job done and help launch and support the product.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the startup can hardly survive without building an in-house software development team. This is crucial to ensure business continuity and ongoing product evolution, so we must consider the benefits and drawbacks of this approach.</p>
<h2>Building an in-house software development team: pros and cons</h2>
<p>It goes without saying you must have an in-house team of IT specialists, both DevOps engineers and software developers. The question is, when do you have to start building it? We sincerely believe this process should begin ONLY when the product is launched and the startup passes the sustainability point. Only then you will be able to devote the significant resources (be it the next round of investments or product-generated revenues) to building an in-house software development team. Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>In-house specialists are on the payroll</b>. Whether they have their hands full with bringing more value to the product or devote the minimum effort to ensuring the product’s stable performance at the moment — you have to pay them wages monthly.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>In-house</b> software developers and DevOps engineers <b>have to build the teams, the workflows, and the corporate culture as they go</b>. It is a long process of utmost importance, as the errors there can cost you dearly.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">You have to hire the in-house software development team one by one, which is not an easy task. This means <b>certain parts of the product (or its delivery pipeline) might be put on hold</b> till the appropriate IT specialist is hired. The MSP can step in with the outstaffing assistance, yet eventually, all of the key team positions should be filled by in-house staff.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">As you will most likely hire a single specialist to cover each workflow part, <b>if this employee goes on vacation, quits or even takes a sick leave, the corresponding part of the process comes to a halt</b>. IT outstaffing can be a temporary solution, too, yet ensuring the redundancy by hiring at least a pair of IT specialists to cover each aspect of the workflow. This means paying 2 salaries, sure.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2995" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Software-development-team-VS-building-it-in-house-ITSvit_3.jpg" alt="Hiring a dedicated software development team VS building it in-house_3" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>Nevertheless, building an in-house team of software developers is hugely beneficial for a startup for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Experience continuity an in-depth product knowledge</b>. The team that works on your product day by day knows it better than any contractor and can assess the current state of affairs and the preferred direction of product evolution.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Company culture and 24/7 availability</b>. Your personnel develops respect and proper attitude towards the company if you treat them right. This makes working long hours and dealing with issues outside of work hours much easier, should such a need arise.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Stockpiling skills means adding value</b>. If your in-house team of software developers is properly motivated they pay sufficient attention to self-development, gain new skills and become more valuable as professionals. They tend to ask for bigger salaries then, yes, but having a proficient, skilled and motivated software development team on board is a huge benefit of its own. Such a team can both drive more value to your customers and increase the value of your startup in case of exit, merger or acquisition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, it doesn’t mean you have to avoid hiring an in-house software development team. We only suggest you do so once you are able to support the team and scale the business quickly. Until then, hiring a dedicated team of IT engineers from any MSP should suffice.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2994" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Software-development-team-VS-building-it-in-house-ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="Hiring a dedicated software development team VS building it in-house_2" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<h2>Final thoughts on hiring a dedicated software development team VS building it in-house</h2>
<p>As you can see, both hiring a dedicated software development team from a managed services provider or building an in-house team of software developers are viable choices for a startup. Being an MSP ourselves, IT Svit sincerely recommends hiring a dedicated team to deliver an MVP and release the product prior to building an in-house team to support and evolve the product further. The choice is up to a startup, of course, and if the startup decides to opt for the former approach, the only question left is how to hire a reliable team of developers from a trustworthy MSP. We cover this topic in one of the next articles of this series.</p>
