										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US is the primary market for all modern applications, and if you want to succeed there, you must use cloud application services. IT Svit delivers in-depth expertise with running and managing application cloud services to help your company succeed on the market.<span id="more-7928"></span></p>
<p>Developing useful and popular applications demands a polished and reliable software delivery process with predictable releases and short feedback loops. Using cloud application services for software development enables this approach. IT Svit helps configure cloud services for app development, so your team can concentrate on building great products, instead of managing virtual servers.</p>
<h2>Optimization of the Google App Engine cloud service systems</h2>
<p>Any customer can rent and start using Google App Engine on his own, thus enabling rapid cloud service app development and reliable releases with quick roll-back options. However, while everybody can start using this cloud service for app delivery, it is quite hard to configure it in the most robust and cost-efficient way from the very start. IT Svit can help with this task, as we have ample experience with optimizing the existing cloud infrastructure to deliver top-notch results.</p>
<h2>Can I get long-term cloud services for my app?</h2>
<p>Every startup wants to be as frugal as possible and spend little money until it surpasses the breakeven point. This is why many companies prefer to use the absolute minimum of cloud services for app development and avoid hiring external help. However, this quite often leads to building inefficient infrastructures that have to be rebuilt once you start to scale and they begin to hinder your growth. This is why the best solution is to actually get long-term services for app development from the very start — and IT Svit is glad to provide them!</p>
<h2>Cloud app services for every business from a reliable provider</h2>
<p>The startup scene is booming, as the rise of new technologies opens new wide horizons for developing new exciting products and changing new areas of our lives fr better. However, in order to succeed, your product must meet several crucial requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">it must solve some important problem or address some pain of your target audience</li>
<li aria-level="1">it must be user-friendly and easy to use</li>
<li aria-level="1">it must be available at all times and for any numbers of end-users</li>
<li aria-level="1">it must have unique features that make it memorable</li>
<li aria-level="1">it must have short feedback loops, so customer feedback is quickly integrated into the new product or service features</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, most startups and small-to-medium businesses are building their apps on cloud infrastructure from the start. This is only natural, as there are specific cloud products that provide the full cycle of services for startups, enabling them to build, test and release their products cost-efficiently, like IBM Cloud Foundry, Google App Engine or AWS Pipeline.</p>
<p>These products consist of a couple of main and several supplementary systems with predefined configurations. For example, Google App Engine automates the setup and configuration of build, testing and staging environments, as well as enabling automated code pushes to and releases. This removes a great deal of pressure from your developers, allowing them to do what they do best — create exciting product features, instead of configuring the cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>However, code development is not the only part of the software delivery, nor is it the most important one. Even the best-built product will be useless if it is inaccessible for the customers. Thus said, the main part of the software lifecycle begins only once the code is released to production. It must work 24/7, be available to customers worldwide without lags, you must be able to keep a close eye on their performance, monitor and log the systems, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, most of these functions are provided by Google Cloud Platform, but they must be enabled and appropriately configured to run at full capacity. Some of the businesses decide to go full-out with the cloud vendor of their choice and hire their certified software engineers to build scalable and easily-manageable cloud app services. However, this is not the most cost-efficient approach and here is why.</p>
<p>Google software engineers will build excellent software delivery pipelines based on Google App Engine, which will provide operational continuity, traceability and manageability. There will be but three downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">these infrastructures will be configured by Google cloud engineers for Google Cloud engineers. If something outside of the depth of an ordinary IT engineer takes place, you will need to issue a ticket to a general queue along with the other customers. And while Google engineers will probably solve the issue in under the 4 hour time period covered by NDA, something your in-house specialists can’t solve easily can usually be mission-critical for your business. Waiting for 4 hours while your app is down and cannot be rebooted is a nightmare any cloud app service user fears.</li>
<li aria-level="1">the systems and workflows set up by Google staff will work in excellent cohesion because these will be Google Cloud services — and they cost money to use. Meanwhile, there are free-to-use open-source alternatives, that do exactly the same thing and work exactly as well — but Google staff will not use them, of course. Thus said, you might end up overpaying for the system components you could have gotten free of charge.</li>
<li aria-level="1">there might come a time when you decide to leave for greener pastures. While renting cloud resources is definitely cheaper for a startup than buying and maintaining the servers in-house, it will not always be that way. When your product becomes popular and you begin to scale, the bills for cloud application services can skyrocket, especially if you run a bunch of platform-specific tools like Google BigQuery or Google Functions. This is vendor lock-in, a situation you do not want to find yourself in.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7930" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ItSvit_CloudApp_Cloud-application-services-optimization-min.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ItSvit_CloudApp_Cloud-application-services-optimization-min.jpg 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ItSvit_CloudApp_Cloud-application-services-optimization-min-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h3>Cloud application services optimization</h3>
<p>There might come the time when you will ask a question: &#8211; is there a way to optimize cloud services for my app and make them more cost-efficient? IT Svit handles such tasks quite frequently, and we can help your company to both optimize the cloud app services in use or migrate your workflows and infrastructure to an on-prem cloud, mirroring all the functionality of vendor-specific tools with open-source analogs.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can help rebuild your cloud infrastructure and workflows to use fewer resources without any compromise on quality. This can be done by enabling load balancing and auto-scaling groups for your production environment, IaC, CI and CD processes for your software delivery workflows and infrastructure management processes.</p>
<h3>Long-term support for application cloud services from IT Svit</h3>
<p>While some companies stay with their cloud vendor support and some try to hire DevOps engineers in-house, quite a lot of startups prefer to outsource cloud services &amp; app development to trustworthy contractors like IT Svit. This ensures all the challenges are taken care of and your application is developed and managed cost-efficiently, allowing you to concentrate more on growing your business, and less on configuring and rebooting the servers.</p>
<p>We can step in on any stage — from idea refinement, infrastructure design, implementation and optimization to full-time support of your cloud systems and workflows. If you need these services — IT Svit is ready to help, just contact us with the project requirements!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/building-and-managing-cloud-app-services-with-it-svit/">Building And Managing Cloud App Services With IT Svit</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are already using cloud services for live TV streaming, you know it is important to procure reliable US-based cloud storage for streaming movies. IT Svit can help use the cloud for movie streaming and our dedicated teams of DevOps engineers can handle all the tasks related to using movie streaming cloud services.<span id="more-7913"></span></p>
<p>More people than ever prefer watching their movies online, instead of going to the cinemas. This provides a wide window of opportunity for live TV and movie streaming businesses. If you run such business or want to start one — IT Svit can help to build and configure cloud services for movie streaming, so you can grow your audience and profit!</p>
<h2>Implementing cloud backup for movie streaming</h2>
<p>Uninterrupted video accessibility is an essential part of providing positive user experience. This can be ensured by the high-availability and scalability features cloud platforms provide, as well as a cloud backup for movies streaming apps and databases. IT Svit can help configure automated backups for your databases and replication for your cloud storage, so your platform is always up and running, even if some region is temporarily inaccessible.</p>
<h2>Optimizing cloud for movies streaming</h2>
<p>Many movie streaming businesses run their services in the cloud using a set of web services provided by their respective vendors. While this might seem a sound business strategy, the total cost of ownership for such systems can be quite high, as all cloud services are paid for. Thus said, it is best to combine vendor-specific and open-source cloud tools to ensure optimal cost-efficiency of your cloud storage for movies streaming. IT Svit provides such optimization, helping businesses get the most out of their cloud investments.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7915" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cloud-for-movies-streaming-02-min.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cloud-for-movies-streaming-02-min.jpg 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cloud-for-movies-streaming-02-min-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2>Fully-managed cloud storage for streaming movies</h2>
<p>There are huge potential profits in the movie streaming business, as the spread of 3G/4G/5G Internet allows millions of people to get access to the vast storage of movies and watch them online. This, in turn, means immense profits from ads and paid subscriptions — and requires lots of effort to ensure your live TV and movie streaming platform runs well. Using cloud computing is very beneficial in this regard, as it helps solve all the challenges of running a movie streaming business.</p>
<p>These challenges include the need to store huge volumes of data and stream it seamlessly, maintain an index of all the movies and live TV records at your disposal and provide quick search across this index, support comments and chats functionality, etc. However, while these tasks can be solved once and for all, there are challenges like live replication of your databases and data sets, or in-depth real-time monitoring and alerting to ensure continuity of operations, which requires a continuous effort.</p>
<p>Using cloud computing for hosting your live TV and movie streaming platform helps solve all these challenges, both the initial and the continuous ones. Leveraging the benefits of cloud computing for movie streaming means making use of scalability, robust features, high-availability and resilience the cloud vendors like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure provide.</p>
<p>These benefits are based on several major principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Virtualization.</b> Cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, MS Azure, IBM, Digital Ocean, etc. run multiple data centers, where all the hardware resources are united in a single pool through virtualization. Every customer rents some amount of resources and uses them within his account. Cloud customers don’t buy servers or other equipment, which effectively reduces their CAPEX to zero.</li>
<li><b>Scalability</b>. You can scale your operations up and down based on demand, and virtualization makes it a quick and simple process. You can either rent more pre-configured instances (horizontal scaling) or increase the resource quotas for your existing account (vertical scaling). Both methods are quick to apply and ensure you get the required resources quickly and can shut them down once you no longer need them.</li>
<li><b>High-availability</b>.Scalability leads to the fact that your systems can handle any workload and be available to any number of end-users, be it 1,000 or 100,000 a second. Due to virtualization and replication, multiple cloud regions can serve your customers, instead of limiting them to the throughput capacity of a single bare-metal server cluster. For example, front-end parts of your platform can be running on a CDN &#8211; Content Delivery Network, like Cloudflare or Amazon CloudFront or Google Cloud CDN. This helps provide reliable access for your customers due to using cloud computing services for movie streaming.</li>
<li><b>Cost-efficiency</b>. The cloud operates under the Pay-As-You-Go principle, meaning the customers pay per second for the resources consumed (or for a millisecond for some services like AWS Lambda or Google Functions). Thus said, it is much more cost-efficient as compared to renting dedicated servers in remote data centers (or buying these servers in-house) that run 24/7 even when your team does not need them.</li>
<li><b>Security</b>. There is some aversion to storing your mission-critical systems and sensitive data in the cloud, due to regular reports of new celebrity photo leakages. However, the US DoD stores their data with AWS, as well as CIA, and MS Azure hosts 80% of Fortune 500 companies — and these industry-leading enterprises and government institutions take their security with utmost seriousness. Due to multiple structural and procedural security features and layers, cloud hosting is actually very secure. It can even withstand a DDoS attack due to the ability to work with CDNs, which distribute the load and help speed-up the content delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are cloud-based web services like Amazon S3 or Google Storage for storing the movie archive, Big Data and query tools like Google Big Query for performing the data mining, indexing and processing for you, as well as Amazon web services like Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon CloudWatch Logs to enable in-depth monitoring of your cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>The only downside to working with these tools is that they are vendor-specific and cost money to use. Thus said, while you can cover all your business requirements using tools and services from the cloud vendor of your choice, you will end up with vendor lock-in and the total cost of ownership for such a system can be quite high.</p>
<p>How to avoid it? The main approach many businesses follow is to hire external expertise to handle their cloud operations without interacting with the support engineers from their cloud platform. While recruiting such talents in-house can be a long and risky process, many companies prefer to outsource <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/cloud-computing/">cloud computing</a> management for streaming movies to a trustworthy Managed Services Provider like IT Svit.</p>
<p>Over 5 years of expertise in managing the cloud for movie streaming services help IT Svit design and implement the environments and workflows required to develop a movie streaming platform and run it. We ensure your application uses all the benefits of cloud computing and provides all the features your end-users would expect, so they receive positive user experience and promote your brand. If this sounds like something you are looking for — let us know and IT Svit would be glad to deliver cloud services for movies streaming!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/it-svit-helps-use-cloud-services-for-movies-streaming/">IT Svit Helps Use Cloud Services For Movies Streaming</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT Svit has in-depth experience with cryptocurrency cloud services. We provide blockchain development and infrastructure, cloud storage for cryptocurrency and other IT outsourcing services from our dedicated teams.<span id="more-7909"></span></p>
<p>If your business wants to develop an innovative solution based on the blockchain technology, you need to use the best <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/cloud-computing/">cloud computing services</a> for cryptocurrency development and ongoing support. Using cloud computing for cryptocurrency operations ensures shorter time-to-market and better cost-efficiency of your software delivery workflows. IT Svit helps reach your business objectives by providing top-notch cloud services for cryptocurrency development and operations.</p>
<h2>Configuring cloud backup for cryptocurrency projects</h2>
<p>Blockchain provides an immutable ledger of records for decentralized computations but requires immense scalability to keep the system fault-tolerant and able to process any amounts of data. Enabling this level of performance requires configuring cloud backup for cryptocurrency development and management operations to keep the system operational at all times. IT Svit has ample experience with enabling automated backup for blockchain operations.</p>
<h2>Managing cloud infrastructure for cryptocurrency operations</h2>
<p>Many businesses start cloud infrastructure operations for cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions on their own. However, with time it often becomes apparent these systems are not well-configured and begin to hinder your business growth. IT Svit can help reconfigure your existing cloud services for cryptocurrency to ensure their maximum performance, resilience and cost-efficiency of operations.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7911" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Itsvit_cryptocurrency_using-cloud_22-min.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Itsvit_cryptocurrency_using-cloud_22-min.jpg 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Itsvit_cryptocurrency_using-cloud_22-min-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency cloud services from IT Svit</h2>
<p>If your business operates some kind of blockchain-based application or service, you want it to run flawlessly, synchronize seamlessly across the network and provide secure data storage for personal details of your customers. Thus said, using cloud computing for cryptocurrency solutions is the obvious choice, as cloud platforms handle most of your challenges out of the box. However, configuring the cloud services correctly to ensure maximum ROI for your company requires quite a deep level of expertise, which is not easy to come by. IT Svit provides this expertise, as we have more than 4 years of experience delivering cloud services for cryptocurrency projects of any scope.</p>
<p>For example, your business might be running a cryptocurrency exchange. This means you will have to run several replicas of your ledger and you will want to put your blockchain wallet applications in containers. This way, whenever a customer logs into a system, your infrastructure spins up a secure, secluded and closely monitored environment, which is beneficial both for you and for your customer. His billing details and history of transactions are secure, while you are sure even a malicious intent will lead to nothing, as no user can access anything outside of his account, if it is run in a container.</p>
<p>IT Svit has provided cryptocurrency cloud computing services for a big fiat-to-crypto exchange that allowed its customers to trade in 14 different cryptocurrencies and more than a hundred of fiat currencies. We built the infrastructure in such a way that each wallet had a separate container for every type of cryptocurrency it operated, so switching to another currency required a container reboot. Due to using Terraform, Kubernetes, Spinnaker, Jenkins Ansible and other tools, we were able to ensure these containers were spun up in seconds, so the end user barely noticed anything, but the customer enjoyed a safety of mind.</p>
<h3>Using the cloud for cryptocurrency and blockchain app development</h3>
<p>Another important aspect of using the cloud computing for cryptocurrency operations is actually doing your blockchain app development in the cloud or moving it to the cloud. This allows saving lots of time due to enabling you to utilize all the benefits of the cloud: scalability, high-availability, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, Continuous Monitoring and smart alerting, immense amounts of automation for every possible operation, etc.</p>
<p>For example, IT Svit received a fair share of blockchain development projects, which involved building either an app with Ethereum smart contracts, or launching a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Some of these projects were cloud-native from the start, some had to be moved to the cloud from their original on-prem development environments.</p>
<p>Working in the cloud helped us ensure the required dev, build, testing and staging environments were provisioned and configured quickly and without issues. It was made possible thanks to Terraform and Kubernetes manifests, Jenkins workers, Ansible playbooks and other means to automate infrastructure deployment and ensure there is no room for human error.</p>
<p>As for the cryptocurrency application and platform development itself, we can do it in PHP/Laravel, Python/Django, Java or Node/React/Vue.js, etc. We have in-depth experience with both Ethereum RC20 smart contracts, Bitcoin architecture and Ripple structure, enabling us to develop blockchain applications for literally any business need.</p>
<h3>IT Svit manages cloud computing for cryptocurrency operations</h3>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of partnership with a Managed Services Provider like IT Svit for any cryptocurrency-operating business lies in the fact that we have in-depth knowledge of all the aspects of software delivery — from design and development to testing and release, as well as monitoring and ongoing maintenance of your applications in production. We can onboard the project at any stage and help successfully accomplish any tasks that stand before your business.</p>
<p>We can build a new blockchain application from scratch, can provide QA and testing for an existing app, can enable CI/CD processes for your development, can build rolling update routines for delivering new features, can enable scalability and high availability for your production environments, and can configure monitoring, logging and alerting for your systems.</p>
<p>If any of this rings a bell — IT Svit would be glad to help you with cryptocurrency cloud services, so just contact us with your project specifications and let’s talk business!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/cryptocurrency-cloud-services-for-any-business/">Cryptocurrency Cloud Services For Any Business</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are the US-based energy company in need of cloud computing services — you’ve come to the right place! IT Svit is an IT outsourcing provider that fields experienced dedicated teams that can manage the cloud infrastructure for the energy company.</p>
<p><span id="more-7905"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern energy industry is unlike anything that was before. Thousands of private energy producers trade power via blockchain ledgers and operate edge computing nodes on their home power plants. If you want to succeed in this highly-competitive market — IT Svit can help enable cloud services for your energy company. From application development to cloud infrastructure management — we’ve got your cloud service requirements covered!  </span></p>
<h3>We configure cloud storage for your energy company</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy business benefits from the cloud services as much as any other. When your systems are safe and sound in the cloud, are able to handle any numbers of connections and store your data securely using the cloud services — you can do much more while spending much less. IT Svit is proficient in delivering cloud storage for the energy industry and configuring all kinds of cloud services your business might need.</span></p>
<h3>Reduction of expenses and better operational flexibility for your energy business</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the energy companies that come to IT Svit think they need the cloud to reduce their operational expenses and increase their flexibility. As it often turns out, we can provide much more value, from automating various aspects of infrastructure operations to rebuilding the process of interaction with your external system components through using the latest RESTful APIs and much, much more.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7907" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Energy-company-cloud-02-min.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Energy-company-cloud-02-min.jpg 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Energy-company-cloud-02-min-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2>We excel at managing the cloud infrastructure for the energy company!</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business should evolve and adopt the latest technology to remain competitive, and the energy industry is no exception. Oil and gas companies that invested heavily in their mainframe systems, now seek the ways to automate their operations and make them more error-proof and not reliant on manual control. Cloud computing provides this possibility, as all the software and drivers used to operate the machinery can be run as virtualized applications in Docker containers, to ensure their fault-tolerance, scalability and resilience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, lowering the expenses is not as crucial for the energy companies as increasing the speed and reliability of operations. Using the cloud infrastructure for the cloud company means the ability to transfer huge quantities of data between on-prem installation and devices, process it in the cloud and ensure their security and compliance — as the energy industry is one of the most heavily regulated domains of business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cloud backup for the energy industry data means SOX compliance is much easier to manage, as the data can be quickly backed up and restored using the cloud storage like Amazon S3 or Google Storage. System monitoring, billing, accounting. sending automated reports to regulatory bodies through RESTful APIs — the benefits of using cloud services for the energy industry are literally endless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main issue here is not to rush the cloud implementation, as the cloud services are no panacea for the energy industry. In order to be efficient, these systems must be well-thought-out, built and configured correctly, so they solve the energy business challenges, instead of introducing the new ones. This is why IT Svit recommends performing the transition to cloud computing for the energy company in three major stages.</span><b></b></p>
<h3>Build the roadmap of the needed improvements using internal experts</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed Services Providers like IT Svit can configure the cloud computing services and build the CI/CD pipelines for developing new modules for your applications — but only your in-house engineers know how your systems work, what the bottlenecks are and how to remove them with the utmost efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus said, understanding what is wrong with the current workflows and how this can be mended can be very beneficial before adopting cloud computing for the energy company. Build the detailed scheme of your systems, tools and workflows, highlight the performance bottlenecks and describe what you want — then let the IT services provider do what needs to be done in order to achieve these results. This way you will be able to formulate the business objectives you want to achieve, and we will be able to propose the best ways to do it.</span></p>
<h3>Keep a close eye on interoperability and integrations</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every energy industry company has to interact with various third-party businesses and regulatory bodies. Over the time of your being in the business, you surely had instated some processes and tools for such interactions, and these can be affected when moving to the cloud. Understanding the way these interactions work and how they can be replaced and improved by using cloud services for the energy company is crucial for ensuring your cloud transition is successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to deal with this transition is to have a fully-integrated cloud database solution able to interact with all your external contractors via RESTful APIs. However, the system and infrastructure of your partners can not be ready for such a transaction, and you cannot operate in a vacuum. Thus said, it is best to consult with your long-term partners and discuss the best ways to proceed with your digital transformation, so they can keep up and the normal flow of business interactions is not disrupted.</span></p>
<h3>Treat the cloud as a tool, not the goal</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving to the cloud infrastructure for the energy company is not the goal of the project, it is merely the means to an end. The ultimate goal of such a transition is to ensure better operational flexibility and future-proof your business, so you are able to innovate better and grow exponentially. This can be achieved by introducing a new business culture and better understanding the ways to use cloud services for the energy industry businesses, to plan proactively and react to new circumstances rapidly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Svit is an IT outsourcing provider with 15 years of expertise in providing remote system administration services, a decade of hands-on experience in software delivery and 5 years in providing DevOps services and cloud infrastructure management. We know how to use cloud services to reach specific goals of any business — but it is up to you to provide the list of specific goals you need to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus said, IT Svit can help your energy company with the full range of cloud services:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessment of your existing infrastructure and processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forming a list of suggestions to overcome the existing bottlenecks based on input from your stakeholders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing these solutions to streamline your processes and increase their efficiency</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving your data and workflows to the cloud seamlessly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enabling CI/CD processes for software delivery processes and the management of cloud infrastructure for the cloud company</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building logging, monitoring, and smart alerting solutions for your business</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business providing streaming cloud services for the customers in the US and globally must use the most reliable cloud storage for video streaming and uninterrupted availability. IT Svit provides skilled DevOps dedicated teams that configure and manage video streaming cloud services.</span><span id="more-7899"></span></p>
<p>Using cloud computing for video streaming enables thousands of simultaneous connections worldwide to your platform and multiple interactions like chatting, SuperChatting, free and paid subscriptions, donating through various payment gateways. All of these features depend on the seamless interaction of several cloud components, which is crucial for providing a positive end-user experience. IT Svit helps configure the cloud infrastructure required for this.</p>
<h2>Enabling cloud backup for video streaming services</h2>
<p>Lots of data must be processed in real-time when operating video streaming cloud computing services. However, connection breaks still happen and not all video data gets rendered and saved in time. This is why enabling various kinds of cloud backup for video streaming is crucial. Caching and periodic automated database backups ensure the integrity and continuity of services provided. Our <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps engineers</a> can configure cost-efficient and reliable cloud backup procedures for streaming.</p>
<h2>CI/CD cloud services for video streaming</h2>
<p>No product is perfect from the get-go, and this applies to cloud video streaming services as well. They must be further developed and improved after release while ensuring the video streaming platform updates and new features don’t interfere with the uninterrupted availability of services in operation. IT Svit ensures this by enabling CI/CD workflows for your ongoing software development and cloud infrastructure management. We can ensure your platform works without lags and is updated without downtime!</p>
<h2>Full range of video streaming cloud services for your business!</h2>
<p>Every business aiming to build a successful video streaming platform needs to ensure it provides a range of useful features. Video streaming and storing the videos left aside, there should be the ability to chat with the streamer and store the records of these chats, make donations in any currency and through a variety of payment gateways, provide some account analytics, etc. In some cases, there might be a need for private chat rooms, as well as using virtual reality equipment or some other latest technological innovation.</p>
<p>Thus said, while all of these functions are nice to have, it is hard to implement them all at once. This means that your cloud video streaming service must be lean and frugal at the start. Most of the video streaming businesses begin by building the most basic functions into their platform and releasing the MVP to start rolling the money in. Once the business passes the breakeven point and starts to grow — it’s time to add more features to further secure your position and reach new horizons.</p>
<p>Thus said, there are 3 distinctive phases of software delivery for every video streaming platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>initial cloud infrastructure configuration and MVP development</li>
<li>product release and ongoing development</li>
<li>scaling to enterprise and continuous monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these phases has its unique challenges and requires specific tools and skills to solve them.</p>
<p>The first phase of software development starts with the design of the future platform. Based on the project requirements, it is best to plan the structure to be modular and make the modules interact via RESTful APIs, so any number of additional modules can be easily added to the system and integrated with the existing functionality seamlessly.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7901" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Cloud-for-video-streaming_2-min.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Cloud-for-video-streaming_2-min.jpg 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Cloud-for-video-streaming_2-min-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>It is also needed to correctly configure the future infrastructure supporting <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/cloud-computing/">cloud computing</a> for video streaming. The environments should be virtualized to enable rapid deployment and decommissioning upon request. All the instances should be exactly the same to minimize the risk of misconfiguration and critical bugs hampering the production. The software delivery process must be reliable and new features must be delivered according to the schedule. The infrastructure operations must be transparent and take as little time as possible.</p>
<p>Using cloud computing for video streaming solves all of these challenges.</p>
<ol>
<li>All cloud computing resources are virtualized, so any type of cloud environment you need can be almost instantly provisioned and configured. It can be shut down as easily when it is no longer needed.</li>
<li>Using Docker containers running in Kubernetes clusters ensures all the copies of your app running in production are the same, so-called Infrastructure as Code approach. Your application runs atop the same infrastructure all the way from the Individual Development Environment to testing, staging and production environments. This means there is no configuration drift between various servers, effectively nullifying the risk of bugs making their way to production or security breaches resulting from overdue security patches. Besides, when each platform component runs as a separate microservice inside a Docker container and interacts with the other modules via RESTful APIs, the resulting system is modular and easy to upgrade.</li>
<li>Cloud services enable Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Integration (CI) of new code into your project, reducing time-to-market significantly and enabling your developers to produce new features on time and according to the schedule. This is possible due to the ability to configure multiple cloud computing services and tools to automatically use the output of one operation as an input of another operation. This helps automate various routine monitoring, logging, cloud backup and restoration operations, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted operations of your video streaming services.</li>
<li>The same CI/CD principles work in monitoring and logging so that your systems are always under control and smart alerts are in place. This way, instead of dealing with the consequences of infrastructure failure, your team will be able to respond at the early stages and mitigate the danger early. For example, the rapid increase of active connections can cause lags and stream crash situations if the system cannot handle such workloads. Launching additional app instances as Docker containers on the Kubernetes cluster can happen automatically as a response to workload growth. Most importantly, the system monitors the workload automatically, and once the peak load is over, excessive instances will be shut down automatically, ensuring cost-efficiency, manageability and transparency of your cloud computing operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>IT Svit helps make this situation a reality by providing expert cloud services for video streaming. As a Managed Services Provider, we can help at any stage, from providing cloud architects and developers to build the video streaming application for your business, all the way to helping to optimize the infrastructure and workflows in place. We manage cloud computing for streaming services for more than 5 years and have amassed lots of ready solutions for most typical challenges, reducing the time needed to accomplish your project.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we are an IT outsourcing company, meaning you gain instant access to dedicated teams of qualified specialists with polished workflows, which costs less than gathering such a team in-house — and brings fruit earlier! If this sounds like something your startup needs — IT Svit would be glad to help configure and run cloud services for streaming for you!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/cloud-services-for-video-streaming-from-it-svit/">Cloud Services For Video Streaming From IT Svit</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud HR consulting services are essential for any company that aims to provide a full cycle of care competitively and cost-efficiently. Dedicated teams of DevOps engineers from IT Svit configure and manage cloud computing for HR businesses from the US and worldwide.</span><span id="more-7890"></span></p>
<p>HR business is very competitive as is, so your company needs to be able to utilize every bit of advantage you can get in order to succeed. There are multiple benefits in cloud computing for HR companies — from cost-efficiency and scalability of operations to data security and compliance. IT Svit provides <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/cloud-computing/">cloud services</a> HR businesses need — from enabling CI/CD pipelines for developing your products to building scalable cloud systems with in-depth monitoring. If this is what you need — we are ready to help!</p>
<h2>Full-range of cloud services HR business requires</h2>
<p>If your company provides HR services and consulting, you need to store lots of sensitive data securely, provide convenient access to it through a robust app with useful features and implement customer feedback quickly to remain competitive. IT Svit helps reach all of these goals, from managing cloud-based data for HR companies to implementing CI/CD pipelines for software delivery and cloud infrastructure management.</p>
<h2>Managing cloud computing for HR solutions</h2>
<p>Running cloud-based HR solutions with hundreds of customers and thousands of users requires uninterrupted and reliable performance of cloud infrastructure. IT Svit has in-depth expertise with designing, implementing, optimizing and managing cloud computing for HR. We can help you deploy, run and optimize your AWS or GCP infrastructure, so you can concentrate on growing your business, instead of handling your cloud systems.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7893" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_HR-cloud-services_2-min.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_HR-cloud-services_2-min.jpg 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_HR-cloud-services_2-min-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h1>IT Svit provides cloud HR consulting services</h1>
<p>HR and recruitment industry is one of the most competitive business domains nowadays. The companies that wish to succeed with their HR initiatives — either using them internally or providing HR-related products and services — must use the best technology and tools at their disposal to remain competitive and succeed in this high-paced market.</p>
<p>This is why many HR businesses come to a realization of the need to move their operations to the cloud, to ensure their app is developed on time, runs smoothly, is robust and integrates well with various third-party software, etc. Using cloud computing for HR provides safety of mind regarding things like scalability, cybersecurity, predictability of development, manageability of operations and speed of incident response. It also enables the implementation of <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps services</a>, meaning things like CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, seamless updates, automated cloud configuration and management.</p>
<p>There is, however, some seemingly rational aversion to moving the corporate data to the cloud. Trusting some remote company to store your sensitive information, personal details and billing information of your employees is hard. This is why various businesses, especially the enterprise-grade global businesses, prefer to maintain their own data centers and store all the information there.</p>
<p>However, this approach has several significant shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Huge capital expenses</b>. In order to store your data and run your HR systems on internal servers, you need to build a server room or an on-prem data center. It will require duplicate power lines and secondary Internet access channels, industrial air conditioning and water cooling units, fire prevention and humidity control systems, etc. In addition, to ensure your servers are safe, you should replicate the data to a mirror server and reroute the traffic using a load balancer. Thus said, to have 1 server with your HR solution in-house, you need to pay for 3 servers and a bunch of supplementary equipment, which is quite costly.</li>
<li><b>Huge operational expenses</b>. Your servers run 24/7, while your employees work for 8-9 hours a data only. Add the days off, weekends, vacations and state holidays — and the total sum of overpayment on your OPEX can reach up to 40%. Add the salary expenses for the engineering personnel, and the TCO (total cost of ownership) skyrockets all of a sudden.</li>
<li><b>Long product development cycles</b>. Regardless if you develop your own HR solution or run some box version of a popular HRM system on your in-house servers, updating and adding new features to it will be an effort- and resource-costing endeavor. Building a Git-based workflow of software development, testing and release on-prem requires lots of time and costs quite a sum, as your IT department has to devote lots of time to manually provisioning and configuring various testing environments and virtual servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reasons above contribute to the general situation where both global enterprises and small to medium businesses consider moving their HR systems to the cloud. This helps solve all of the conundrums above:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>No upfront CAPEX</b>. When you rent the cloud infrastructure, you need not buy the servers you use. You pay only for the cloud computing resources usage, not for the equipment and hardware used to deliver these resources, as the cost of this equipment is spread amidst all the cloud users. This way, you end up paying approx 0,001 of the actual equipment cost, instead of paying for all 100%.</li>
<li><b>Reduced OPEX</b>. Cloud systems scale up and down easily, both horizontally and vertically. As all the resources are virtualized, you can add the needed quantities of anything you need, be it CPU, RAM, disk space — or launch multiple instances with predefined quotas to meet the demand, should the need arise. Most importantly, these instances both come online in mere seconds and can be shut down in mere seconds, so you never overpay for the resources you do not actually use.</li>
<li><b>Short time-to-market</b>. Due to rapid provisioning and automated configuration of the required environments, the software development and infrastructure management processes speed up significantly. This helps reduce the time required for developing new product features or integrating it with third-party modules by a huge percentage, effectively shortening the time-to-market for new features tenfold.</li>
</ul>
<p>These results seem too good to be true? Well, the catch is that all of these benefits apply only if your cloud computing for HR system is configured correctly. Thus said, to configure the cloud services for HR correctly your IT team must have previous successful experience of accomplishing such projects, which is quite hard to come by.</p>
<p>This is why many businesses that either provide HR products or use them in their operations decide to go for cloud HR consulting services from companies like IT Svit. Our vast expertise in delivering cloud management services helps us configure the required infrastructure and workflows to ensure maximum performance, cost-efficiency, resilience and predictability of IT operations in the cloud.</p>
<p>This is not the only way to obtain these skills, of course. Your business might try to hire DevOps engineers in-house or subscribe to managed cloud services for HR platforms from cloud vendors like AWS or Google cloud. However, going full-on with subscriptions to cloud-specific services is a direct way to vendor lock-in. On the other hand, you can try to find the needed expertise and hire it in-house, but this process is subject to all the standard dangers of the recruitment process — under-qualification, inexperience, sick leaves or quitting the job mid-project.</p>
<p>This is why gaining instant access to a pool of skilled software engineers is best done by ordering business cloud services for HR systems from a company like IT Svit. We have ample experience in cloud infrastructure management and optimization, which will help your company reach the business objectives and gain a competitive edge in your niche. If this sounds like a good plan for you — contact IT svit today, we are always glad to help!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/hr-cloud-services-from-it-svit/">HR Cloud Services from IT Svit</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Financial cloud services are an important part of any business, be it US-based or global. IT Svit provides experienced DevOps dedicated teams that enable various approaches to use cloud computing in financial services.<span id="more-7886"></span></p>
<p>Every business that interacts with its customers online has to have some sort of financial services in play. Whether your company provides financial services or just accepts some payments for your products and services — this is best done in the cloud. IT Svit helps enable cloud computing in financial services and reach any business objectives your company might have.</p>
<h2>Running your cloud-based financial services</h2>
<p>If your company provides financial services, cloud computing is the best choice to host them. Cloud platforms like AWS or Google provide security, scalability and reliability of operations. IT Svit helps configure cloud computing for financial services to maximize its cost-efficiency, transparency and manageability.</p>
<h2>Building your financial cloud solutions</h2>
<p>If your business has to process lots of financial transactions, it is best to do this in the cloud. This helps keep customer data and billing history in encrypted form in secure databases to prevent any danger of misappropriation or hacking. IT Svit can enable various security measures to keep your customer financial data on the safe side.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7888" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Financial-cloud_Building-solutions_2.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Financial-cloud_Building-solutions_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ItSvit_Financial-cloud_Building-solutions_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2>Using cloud in financial services</h2>
<p>Every business has to interact with its customers somehow. This interaction must involve a financial component, as every business wants to make a profit. Regardless of your business model, whether financial services are the core of your business or just the means to pay for your products or services — this is sensitive information that can be always available and stored securely. Thus said, using the cloud in financial services is an essential component of success for any business.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of the cloud is its scalability. You rent some cloud resources that should be sufficient for your needs, but if they are not enough and you need more — the cloud allows you to get more in seconds while configuring another dedicated server can take up to several hours. As all the cloud resources allocated in the geographical vicinity of your cloud vendor’s availability zone are combined in a common pool using virtualization, you can configure the system to add more resources and scale horizontally and vertically with ease, should the need arise. What is even more important, once the workload spike is over, the excessive resources can easily be shut down and returned to the vendor’s pool, so you don’t overpay for idle servers.</p>
<p>This approach ensures the cost-efficiency of operations and is reflected by the Pay-As-You-Go billing model used in the cloud. You are billed per second (or millisecond for some web services like serverless computing), which helps minimize the bills for your financial services in the cloud.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, security is crucial, and cloud architecture helps ensure security. AWS CloudTrail, Google Security, Kubernetes Pod Security Policies, secure architecture of Docker containers, database encryption and process isolation — all of these features and web services can safeguard the sensitive data of your customers.</p>
<p>Using the cloud to run your financial services ensures the systems are highly secure, perform well under heavy workloads, can scale up and down easily to meet your business demands  — but turning this into reality requires some in-depth understanding of cloud computing, as well as the precise configuration of various systems and web services.</p>
<p>This is where IT Svit steps in. We provide 5+ years of expertise with configuring the cloud computing features to run financial services, so our customers can be sure their projects are always online and run cost-efficiently. From building and running e-Commerce sites to delivering payment processors and enabling the swift performance of distributed apps based on the blockchain technology — IT Svit can handle any implementation of cloud computing for financial services.</p>
<h3>Building solutions for cloud financial services</h3>
<p>All the aforementioned benefits of using cloud computing to run financial services apply only on one condition — if your cloud infrastructure is configured correctly. You need to have an in-depth knowledge of the ways various web services work and interact, what cloud-native AWS or Google Cloud Platform features are essential for running your project and what could be replaced with open-source alternatives with relative ease.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways your cost-efficiency can fail, cloud security can be breached and sensitive data of your customers can be exposed — from subpar system structure planning to incorrect settings of various system components and modules. For example, almost all cloud-based financial services nowadays run atop Kubernetes clusters, but nearly 90% of those are run with Pod Security Policies disabled (as these are disabled by default). Thus said, IT Svit has had a fair share of uncovering potential security breaches, meaning sensitive data and financial transaction details of your business can be at risk.</p>
<p>IT Svit has developed a detailed procedure for building secure, cost-efficient and highly-performant solutions for financial services in the cloud for our customers. We can help redesign the existing systems to correct the initial architectural flaws in your cloud infrastructure, implement new solutions to ensure cost-efficiency and build these solutions to be easily manageable and scalable — but to make certain these don’t scale out of hand.</p>
<p>The last, but not the least important application of cloud computing for financial services is the continuous development of your product to remain competitive on the market. This means implementing CI/CD pipelines — automated processes of interaction between various tools that enable the developers to build, test, perform canary deployments and push their code into production much easier than with a standard Git-flow.</p>
<p>This ensures predictability of releases, transparency of deployments, greatly reduces the number and severity of bugs discovered in production, enormously reduces the feedback loop and time-to-market for new features. The same principles can be applied to cloud infrastructure management, enabling smart monitoring logging and alerting, as well as automated response scenarios for the most common incident types, greatly reducing the strain of managing your daily IT operations in the cloud.</p>
<h3>Why hire IT Svit to manage your cloud-based financial services?</h3>
<p>The key benefit of partnering with a Managed Services Provider like IT Svit is that we are able to provide the full range of software development and cloud infrastructure management services for any aspect of financial services your business is involved with. We can ensure the security of your financial transactions, the resilience of your financial cloud services, the speed and reliability of your software development, updates and monitoring.</p>
<p>Should this sound like the kind of services you need — contact us right away and we would be happy to help implement your next project concerning financial services in the cloud!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/financial-cloud-services-from-it-svit/">Financial cloud services from IT Svit</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many telecom companies based in the US find themselves in need of cloud computing to implement 5G networks. IT Svit provides cloud storage for the telecom industry and fields dedicated teams with wide experience in the telecom cloud services. </span><span id="more-7877"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a telecom company getting ready for the 5G era, you need to get access to the best cloud computing for telecom. Using cloud storage for the telecom industry ensures safety and high-availability of the data, scalability and ease of maintenance for the infrastructure, but most importantly — cost-efficiency of deployment. IT Svit can help you save a fortune on using cloud computing for the telecom industry instead of buying hardware.</span></p>
<h2>Cloud service configuration for your telecom business</h2>
<p>5G networks offer a huge benefit in terms of telecom cloud services — they are built of virtual components, not hardware. This drastically reduces CAPEX and enables simple reconfiguration. IT Svit has ample experience with cloud network management and can help configure any cloud services for the telecom industry.</p>
<h2>SDN, VNF and NFV development and management</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://itsvit.com/services/cloud-computing/">Cloud computing</a> and DevOps tools provide great opportunities for the telecom industry. Running network functions inside Docker containers atop a virtualized infrastructure helps shorten the time of maintenance and network updates many times. IT Svit has ample experience with containerizing various applications and running containers atop Kubernetes clusters.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7880" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_cloud-computing-for-telecom_SDN-VNF-and-NFV_2.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_cloud-computing-for-telecom_SDN-VNF-and-NFV_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_cloud-computing-for-telecom_SDN-VNF-and-NFV_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2>Benefits of cloud computing for the telecom industry</h2>
<p>With worldwide adoption of 5G networks around the corner, many businesses in the telecom industry face the need to update their hardware, software and processes, before these become legacy and impact your competitiveness. There are huge benefits to be had by adopting the telecom industry cloud services early. First, you can save on upgrading your hardware once and for all. Second, you can reconfigure the infrastructure with ease should the need arise. As a dollar saved is a dollar earned, every forward-thinking company can earn millions by using cloud computing for telecom.</p>
<p>This is possible due to the fact that the upcoming 5th generation of networks is not using the same architecture as all the previous ones. With 3G and 4G, you had to buy the hardware with rigid specifications that could be used for intended purposes only. If you needed to add 2 more cables, you needed to add a whole box with 10 slots, etc. If some connection gets fried, you need to buy a new piece of hardware quite often. If a new gadget is not compatible with your devices — you need to update the drivers, which can result in more compatibility issues, etc.</p>
<p>Thus said, 5G is built on the principles of virtualization to avoid the rigid specifications of software and limitations of the hardware. The three basic principles of 5G are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>VNF — Virtual Network Functions — all software (drivers) for the main network components are virtualized. This means that all modules are run as Docker containerized applications atop a virtualized Terraform infrastructure.</li>
<li>NFV — Network Functions Virtualization — the whole network structure runs as a Kubernetes cluster of Docker containers in the cloud, without the need to buy any piece of hardware. Like, ever.</li>
<li>SDN — Software-Defined Networking — using code to define the network settings and parameters. Ansible and Jenkins are the tools allowing to build and configure 5G networks within minutes, not within hours and days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, the 5th generation of networks can be installed for literally no cost, configured in minutes and adjusted on the move should the need arise. This literally saves millions of dollars in terms of CAPEX investments, worktime and reduction of misconfiguration risks. There are many other cloud benefits for telecom.</p>
<h3>Advantages of the cloud services for telecom</h3>
<p>Cloud storage for the telecom industry ensures all the data is securely stored in the cloud in an encrypted form, is easily available from any device and in any geographical location. This is the high-availability feature, made available by replicating the data across distributed clusters of high-velocity databases. This way, all the data is gathered, processed, stored and streamed in real-time in multiple locations across the globe and even a complete power shutdown in one location will not cripple your operations.</p>
<p>Cloud backup for the telecom industry is the natural consequence of cloud data storage. The data is backed up by replicating it across several database instances in a hybrid cloud, so even if on-prem servers get damaged in any disaster, the data is safe and sound in the cloud. The procedure of cloud backup for telecom can be done in batches or in real-time while you are actually streaming, so not a bit of data is lost, ever.</p>
<p>Cloud scalability ensures your systems can handle any number of visitors and any workload. If the monitoring modules detect workload spikes, they spin up more VNFs in seconds, so your system does not lag or crash. Later on, when the spike is over, the excessive VNFs are shut down automatically to conserve your resources.</p>
<p>Cloud services for telecom are cost-efficient, as they are provided under the Pay-As-You-Go billing model. This means that instead of buying or renting hardware servers in dedicated data centers and paying for them 24/7 regardless of the actual resource consumption ratio, cloud users order virtualized instances with some quotas of resources that can be additionally flexibly adjusted.</p>
<p>For example, if you need more CPU power to process large volumes of information or more RAM to do it faster or more disk space to store it — your cloud instance can be scaled up and down both horizontally and vertically. Most importantly, these resources are available at any time and can be provisioned within seconds upon request — and shut down as quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Does it sound great for you? The only question remains — how to gain access to all these tangible benefits? the answer is — by using <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps services</a>!</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7879" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_cloud-computing-for-telecom_Importance-of-DevOps_3.png" alt="" width="1141" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_cloud-computing-for-telecom_Importance-of-DevOps_3.png 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_cloud-computing-for-telecom_Importance-of-DevOps_3-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></p>
<h3>Importance of DevOps cloud services for the telecom industry</h3>
<p>Cloud hosting operates quite differently, as compared to working with dedicated servers or virtual machines that are the mainframe of modern 3G/4G telecom networks. Instead of physical bare-metal servers with limited resource capacities, you operate virtualized instances that draw the needed resources from a common pool. When these resources are not needed, they are returned to the pool to be used — and paid for — by other customers.</p>
<p>This is a great and welcome improvement over the existing situation when a telecom company must be constantly investing in buying new hardware, as the old one rapidly becomes legacy and obsolete. Instead, from 5G going onward, no CAPEX will be required to update your systems. The only OPEX needed is the DevOps expertise to operate the cloud, as the existing telecom industry IT professionals rarely have the skills required to enable VNF, NFV and SDN. They have invaluable experience with specific telecom solutions architecture and best practices of its organization, though.</p>
<p>This is why the best way to approach the oncoming transition to 5G networks is by combining the expertise of your telecom industry computing services with a profound DevOps knowledge from a Managed Services Provider like IT Svit. We have ample experience with software delivery and cloud infrastructure management, and we will be able to apply it to replicating your existing IT infrastructure in the cloud, while also optimizing it to future-proof your operations.</p>
<p>Should this sound like an outcome you would like to achieve — contact IT Svit today and we would be glad to provide top-notch cloud computing services for the telecom industry!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/enabling-cloud-computing-for-telecom-by-it-svit/">Enabling cloud computing for telecom by IT Svit</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses in the US and worldwide must be lean and frugal to increase their chances of survival. This means their IT operations must be as cost-efficient as possible. IT Svit helps achieve this by providing expert managed cloud services for small businesses.</span><span id="more-7864"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every small business is either providing their products and services in the cloud or use it to develop their applications, as it is much more cost-efficient than renting dedicated servers and paying for them 24/7 while using them for 8-10 hours a day at max. IT Svit helps configure cloud computing services for small businesses to ensure you’ve got all your needs covered while spending as little as possible.</span></p>
<h2><b>Enabling Google cloud services for small business</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google App Engine helps startups develop their products quickly and cost-efficiently, as it provides ready infrastructure for development, build and testing environments out of the box, as well as CI/CD pipelines to automate the code delivery process. However, this convenient sandbox has to be modified quite intensely before it can become a production environment. IT Svit helps configure Google Cloud services to meet the needs of a small business.</span></p>
<h2><b>IT Svit delivers cloud IT services for small business</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code development is important, but it is not the only part of IT operations. Once the code is written, it must be released without any system downtime. It must also be monitored in production to ensure the security of operations and updated without interruption of service availability, to ensure positive user experience. IT Svit helps make all of this a reality and provides a full range of IT services for small businesses to help your startup grow and succeed.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7866" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Cloud-Services_benefits_2.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Cloud-Services_benefits_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Cloud-Services_benefits_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h2><b>We configure cloud service for small business, so you can concentrate on growth</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any great idea deserves a chance to be implemented and make this world better. This is why multiple startups create various products and services that aim to make our life better. However, a small business has lots of daunting tasks and challenges ahead of it and dedicating too much time and effort to managing IT resources can be detrimental to your momentum. Your server infrastructure must work like a clock without too much attention and effort from your side — but this is not the case with in-house or dedicated bare-metal servers or virtual machines. They require putting a pretty substantial effort into configuration and ongoing management of your infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing opens new horizons for small businesses, as it provides the means to develop, release and run great products and services cost-efficiently. This is why many startups nowadays are cloud-based and begin their operation in the cloud from the very start — or move there as soon as they secure the initial investment. This allows you to leverage multiple important benefits like integrity, continuity, scalability, security, high-availability and cost-efficiency.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Integrity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you operate a dedicated or in-house server or a cluster of bare-metal servers, each of them must be configured and updated separately and manually. This leads to the so-called configuration drift, where different machines have a different history of updates and differences in configuration parameters. This poses a potential security vulnerability and/or inconsistency in operations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing provides virtualization of resources, where all the server resources are combined into a single pool and are configured uniformly across the instance you use. This prevents configuration drift and ensures the integrity of your infrastructure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Continuity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the biggest problems of software development is that some critical bugs make it to production and cause post-release crashes because there was no possible way to detect them during testing and staging. This is the result of the production environment being slightly — or severely — different from the IDE, testing and canary environments. This severely impacts the reliability and predictability of software delivery and IT operations.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite the contrary, when all the environments involved in software delivery are configured using the same base Docker images, there is no chance of critical bug making it all the way to production undetected. All environments work the same and all the bugs are discovered before the release, ensuring the continuity of the software delivery and infrastructure operations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Scalability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you plan the future infrastructure size, you cannot plan for everything. However, bare-metal servers or virtual machines provide limited resources, so unless you want to risk facing service inoperability, you would have to have a backup server for every service you use running idle just in case. It is also good for backups and load balancing and replication — but it is quite costly. Besides, configuring a new server takes some time, from hours to days at an end.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing operates instances with some resource quotas you can utilize. If — and when — you lack resources, you can scale up horizontally or vertically, increasing either your resource quotas or the number of instances you run. Most importantly, these resources are made available to you immediately and are configured nearly instantly — and are shut down immediately when they are not needed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Configuration drift poses a significant security threat, as malevolent entities will try to use any discrepancy in your systems to gain unauthorized access to your sensitive data and customer details. Besides, there always is a risk of a DDoS attack from competitors, who might want to knock your company out of business.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing has multiple built-in security measures and features that can ensure the safety of your sensitive data. In addition, running the front-end part of your application on CDN means you are safely protected from any DDoS attacks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>High-availability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Only so much users can contact your server at a time, due to traffic limitations and throughput capacity caps of your server’s Ethernet chip. Serving more customers requires having more servers, which is not convenient for the reasons described above. Besides, there can be connectivity issues for some regions, which will hamper your application performance for some part of the audience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using cloud computing services for small business ensures there are as many as needed copies of your application at any point of time, they run in different availability zones across the globe and are replicated with each other, thus ensuring high-availability of your products and services for the audience of any size.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cost-efficiency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is the most important parameter for any startup, as the resources must be spent only on the things you really need. However, while the servers used to run your products or services run 24/7, they are rarely working at full capacity. Moreover, the servers used to develop your product are idling at least 16 hours a day, and for 24 hours during weekends, holidays and vacations. This means you are overpaying for the resources you do not actually use.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using cloud services for small business means your systems always work at nearly top efficiency and you pay only for the resources actually consumed. This provides a huge boost in cost-efficiency, which ensures your business allocates the money correctly and spends only as much as needed on IT operations, without any compromise on product quality.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, cloud computing is not a magic stick too and must be correctly configured in order to provide all the benefits listed above. The issue here is that startups rarely have access to the level of DevOps expertise required to configure cloud IT services correctly and reap all of the benefits listed above. This is why outsourcing this task to a Managed Services Provider like IT Svit is a win-win solution for both parties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have in-depth expertise with cloud infrastructure design and implementation, as well as software development and delivery. We can help your company use cloud IT services for small business to the full extent, increase your impact and help you succeed! If this sounds like something you are interested in — contact IT Svit right away, we are glad to assist!</span></p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/cloud-services-for-small-businesses-from-it-svit/">Cloud services for small businesses from IT Svit</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many businesses in the US and the EU that are using cloud computing for eCommerce operations. IT Svit helps design and implement cloud infrastructure for eCommerce and we field experienced dedicated teams of software engineers to provide the full range of eCommerce cloud services.</p>
<p><span id="more-7857"></span></p>
<p>eCommerce businesses have to run seamlessly and automatically around the clock. Thus said, cloud hosting is the optimal destination for such products, as it ensures your application is accessible around the clock from any location and can scale up and down to meet the customer demands easily. It can also store a history of purchases, interact with multiple third-party modules, use a powerful search engine and much more. IT Svit has huge expertise in developing, implementing and running end-to-end eCommerce cloud services and we can do the same for you!</p>
<h3>Running a cloud infrastructure for eCommerce apps</h3>
<p>Enabling periodic cloud backup for eCommerce platforms ensures your customer’s sensitive details are safe and sound in secure cloud storage. Many vendors provide this service, but to work 100% efficiently it must be configured correctly. IT Svit has ample hands-on experience with running cloud eCommerce services for customers around the globe, ensuring cost-efficiency and security of their operations.</p>
<h3>Building a private cloud for eCommerce</h3>
<p>As data security is obviously one of the main concerns when running eCommerce platforms, many businesses opt for building a private cloud for eCommerce platforms. Bastion host, private subnets, granular access control, cluster security policies and other features must be enabled and configured to ensure the safety7 of private cloud services for eCommerce products. IT Svit can make this a reality and deliver top-notch cloud eCommerce services!</p>
<h2>We build and manage cloud infrastructure for eCommerce platforms</h2>
<p>When you run an eCommerce business, you quickly understand the importance of reliable infrastructure to support it. While most of the eCommerce stores start low and rarely grow enough to leave the initial hosting platform, some do grow into a huge success and have to increase their infrastructure investments to support the continued growth. If this is the situation you find yourself in, using cloud customer architecture for eCommerce solutions ensures cost-efficiency, security and transparency of running your dream online store.</p>
<p>A good CMS that fits your business model can cover almost all your customer-facing business needs for quite a long time. However, once your business reach starts to span across several time zones, countries or even continents, the questions of ensuring availability and scalability begin to prevail. Your eCommerce website should be able to handle hundreds or even thousands of visitors at any given moment (and be able to scale instantly up and down from hundreds to thousands).</p>
<p>It must do this for any geographical region while ensuring the security of end-user personal details and other sensitive data, smooth integration with various third-party modules and cloud service features you did not need previously — like Big Data analytics to personalize your product targeting, or predictive analytics to remove the possibility of downtime and enable self-healing infrastructure. The reasons listed above clearly indicate that going for cloud computing for eCommerce can be the best decision. This is why IT Svit receives a lot of requests for providing various cloud computing services for eCommerce businesses.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7859" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Cloud-computing-for-eCommerce_benefits_2.png" alt="" width="1140" height="595" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Cloud-computing-for-eCommerce_benefits_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ItSvit_Cloud-computing-for-eCommerce_benefits_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<h3>Benefits of cloud services for eCommerce apps</h3>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the list of advantages provided by the cloud for eCommerce applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scalability</b>. Cloud computing resources are virtualized and combined into a general pool spanning the whole data center or an entire region with several data centers. You rent some resources from it when you pay for your cloud computing instance &#8211; just like you would rent a dedicated or virtual server.<br />
However, if your needs exceed the quotas of your instance — you can scale up horizontally, by adding more of the specific resources &#8211; CPU, RAM, disk space, etc. to your instance — or vertically, by launching more instances with predefined quotas of resources. The point is, you can spin up new instances very quickly in the cloud, literally in seconds, instead of hours or days delivery and configuration of a dedicated bare-metal server takes.</li>
<li><b>High availability</b>. When your eCommerce website runs on some dedicated hosting, your traffic and throughput capacity are limited by your package quotas and hardware characteristics. In addition, your server is physically located in some geographical location, and the rest of the globe should connect to it over multiple hops. When you utilize cloud services for eCommerce infrastructure support, you can run multiple instances of your application across the globe, so the workload is evenly spread between them, and their databases are constantly synced to keep the data relevant.<br />
In addition, the front-end part of your eCommerce application can be launched via a CDN or Content Delivery Network like AWS CloudFront, Google CDN or Cloudflare to ensure maximum performance and high availability of your services regardless of the numbers of visitors.</li>
<li><b>Security</b>. Cloud vendors take cybersecurity with the utmost seriousness. They provide various web services and features like AWS CloudTrail and Google Cloud Security, in addition to Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform security mechanisms. Cloud monitoring solutions, from AWS Cloudwatch to products like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack and Splunk, that help monitor, log, analyze and safeguard cloud services for eCommerce platforms.</li>
<li><b>Cost-efficiency</b>. The combination of all the factors above ultimately leads to the cost-efficiency of using cloud computing for eCommerce projects. You can ensure your application has all the required resources, can scale up-and-down depending on the current workloads, benefits from secure cloud storage for eCommerce and can be easily accessed by people around the globe. Most importantly, the system works only when you need it to work, so you don’t pay for idle servers running as backup 24/7. You Pay-As-Yo-Go (PAYG) and you pay only for the resources consumed.<br />
The same results can be achieved using bare metal servers too, but it would require allocating much more resources and the system will be much more prone to fail, as it would include a huge number of modules and processes. On the contrary, when these processes are enabled by cloud infrastructure for eCommerce solutions, your expenses are much lower, as these cloud services are used by lots of customers, so the cost of operations is greatly reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum it up, running cloud eCommerce services helps your business reach new levels of operational stability, performance and efficiency.</p>
<h3>Delivering end-to-end cloud eCommerce solutions</h3>
<p>The main problem with growing your eCommerce platform is that you might outgrow the basic capabilities of your CMS quite soon, and even using multiple plug-ins and add-ons can be insufficient for various business cases. The standard way of solving this issue is by augmenting your eCommerce platform with bespoke modules, custom-tailored to solve your unique challenges.</p>
<p>The standard issue with these custom modules is that they are not compatible with most of the cloud services for eCommerce products and must be rebuilt once you move to the cloud. IT Svit has rich experience in providing end-to-end eCommerce solutions for our customers. From developing custom modules for Magento, Shopify and WooCommerce to building a blockchain-based customer loyalty platform for a network of eCommerce sites. We can build a CI/CD pipeline to minimize time-to-market for your eCommerce app development, ensure its seamless integration with a multitude of other tools, and update your custom system modules to enable them to use the cloud infrastructure for eCommerce to the max.</p>
<p>If you want to get end-to-end cloud service solutions that will help your eCommerce product grow and succeed — contact IT Svit, we are always ready to help!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/cloud-computing-for-ecommerce-businesses-from-it-svit/">Cloud computing for eCommerce businesses from IT Svit</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>
