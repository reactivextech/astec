<p>Great ideas come to us in our sleep, while we drink coffee or commute… In short, it happens all the time, but the ideas on improving some aspects of our daily life quite often occur to us during a crisis, when some limitation or inconvenience becomes blatantly obvious. Besides, as people see a better way to do something and gain immediate benefit our of it, they can form a strong following that will help your startup jump over “The Chasm of Disbelief” between the 10% of early adopters and the rest of the audience, ensuring lasting success for your venture.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1140" height="596" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ItSvit_14-startup_chart_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7721" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ItSvit_14-startup_chart_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ItSvit_14-startup_chart_2-768x402.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></figure>



<p>However, to attract and retain a strong following and to incite trust and engagement in the hearts of your target audience your need to do the things right — and quite a lot of things at that. IT Svit is a worldwide-leading Managed DevOps Services Provider and the leader of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine according to the global technology consultancy Clutch from Washington, DC.</p>



<p>Thus said, we have ample experience with helping startups build Proofs of Concept to attract investment and then we provide Minimal Viable Product development. Based on that experience, we have composed a list of 15 tips that can help ensure long-term success for your startup, even if you found it in the time of crisis. The list is given in no particular order, as there is no magnitude with them — they are all equally important.</p>



<ol><li><b>Your product must solve a real challenge and do it better than the competition</b>. No matter how creative and imaginative your idea is, how polished, intuitive and user-friendly your product is — if it doesn’t solve a real pain for your target audience, it will not be used. In addition, customers are used to having various features for granted, so nobody thinks much of in-app updates on restart, cross-platform and cross-browser availability, automated cloud synchronization, etc. However, your product or service must have that WOW! effect to stand out somehow in a row of similar apps with similar features.</li><li><b>Leaders know the way, show the way and lead the way</b>. Bosses can only boss people around. Leaders are the ones who ignite the teams with their vision of the long-term goal and keep talents motivated long enough to go through the milestones, while also adapting to the changed situation (and making hard decisions, which are quite possible for a startup). You should set an example with your daily drive, work ethics, attitude and productivity — and it’s quite hard to avoid burnout while doing this.</li><li><b>The team rows the boat you steer</b>. You might see the goal and choose the course to reach it, but you need the team to pay the effort needed to reach it. You need to build the right culture and gather around you some people who fit in with your project vision, team culture and business attitude (not to mention they should have the hard and soft skills needed to get the job done).</li><li><b>Ask the ones who have done it — they are usually eager to share the knowledge</b>. There always are conferences and seminars where you can learn from serial entrepreneurs who made their project successful. There always are ample opportunities for mentorship. It is even better at quarantine, as we concentrate more on remote communication and collaboration and are ready to speak with expert practitioners across the globe. Such people are usually glad to be asked for advice and give it — just the same as their mentors did before and you will do afterward.</li><li><b>Corporate culture is the soul of business</b>. You know what you want to reach and what shape your future company must become. But other people will have different expectations and ideas, and to align them with your vision best you should build a strong corporate culture of communication, collaboration and mutual respect. This will make all processes more result-oriented and productive and will help reach the business goals you set.</li><li><b>Do all the paperwork</b>. Establish a business entity to limit your liability in case of business failure. We all know most startups fail, so it’s best to minimize your financial losses in case the project does not take off. It might seem unnecessary during the initial phase of the startup, but setting all legal aspects straight helps immensely in the daily operations of your company. It’s better to pay professionals for a service than file for bankruptcy.</li><li><b>Sign contracts with all partners</b>. Ongoing legal paperwork is as essential as the documents you sign when founding your company. Signing contracts will enable you to clearly define the expectations all parties have, their contractual obligations, the scope of work delivered, billing terms and all other aspects of normal business operations. Otherwise, you risk having to deal with these issues in the court of law, which is costly from the financial and time side of things.</li><li><b>IP protection is a must</b>. Intellectual property rights protect your most essential assets. The products you create and the services you provide, as well as the results of your R&amp;D work, are your intellectual property and must be patented at all times. The history knows too many examples of inventors who did not patent their projects and their competitors reaped all the benefits.</li><li><b>NDA is not always a must</b>. Non-Disclosure Agreement protects your business and must be signed with all employees to ensure you stay on the safe side. However, don’t ask the same from the VC investors, as they have a lot of eggs to fry at the same time, and have to quickly decide whether to invest in your idea or not. Thus, it is much easier for them to invest in your venture if they believe in your idea than to steal the concept and hire another team to implement it. Disclose enough details to persuade potential investors your idea is feasible, but don’t tell them all the details.</li><li><b>Reaching your goal matters, the changes along the way don’t</b>. When you found a startup you have an idea of some improvement in the world around us. Implementing this idea becomes the goal to reach and transforms into a set of features to create in your product, marketing campaigns to launch, characteristics of process to build, etc. However, everything you do must comply with the goal you are after. Sometimes, market conditions change (they change all the time, actually). Thus said, sometimes you need to drop a feature you spent much time developing, only because the market trends have changed and this functionality is not needed anymore. It is important to be able to adapt to circumstances and change your approaches while always keeping your ultimate goal in mind.</li><li><b>Competition is a positive, not a negative factor</b>. Many startups are afraid to enter underdeveloped market niches, as the absence of any competition (or too strong a competition from industry leaders) might mean this field is not going to grow any crops. However, if you clearly see that your product can solve some real-world pain and do it better than it was done before — you can quickly dominate a market niche.<br><br>Airbnb became a hit in a very stale market of apartment rentals due to an innovative approach and competes with hotels/motels quite successfully. Therefore, competition can be an indicator that your ideas are correct and can force you to focus on improving your services.</li><li><b>Prepare a roadmap, but keep your eyes open for new opportunities</b>. Startups must be lean, mean, cost-efficient machines. Do you need a glossy office downtown or can you develop the product from home? Do you need to hunt for A-grade software engineers in the vicinity and wait for them for a long time or can you hire a remote team of professionals and get instant access to the skills you need?<br><br>Prepare a roadmap of what must be done to achieve your ultimate goal, only the most mission-critical decisions you must make — this will help you avoid distractions along the way. However, sometimes opportunities present themselves — but they must be aligned to achieving your goal, or they can become costly mistakes.</li><li><b>Be patient and frugal with money</b>. Money is the blood of your company, as securing the investments and spending them wisely is essential for building a sustainable and profitable business. However, not all investments are equally useful, as the money must come from reputable sources and be coupled with partnerships that will help you further promote your business. Naturally, spending your money wisely is the key to ensuring you are able to achieve the milestones set and evolve your business further.</li><li><b>Innovation means experimenting, not risking</b>. Elon Musk has launched a red convertible into outer space — but there was a decade of experimenting before it — and this decade was paid for by the success of his other projects. To truly innovate you must know your field in detail and be able to go against the grain when needed and show people there is a better way of doing something. This might need lots of convincing, so your proofs must be watertight — meaning you need to experiment a lot and test everything, instead of rushing forward headlong and risking everything.</li><li><b>Build trust through expertise</b>. People are not likely to buy a no-name product from an unknown vendor. You must couple your product development with marketing to help your target audience learn about the upcoming product and form a positive attitude to it. Showing your expertise in the field of operations and demonstrating you care about the problem the product must solve — this is the way to build trust in your audience. Speak at conferences and events; hire technology experts and influencers to showcase your product; work on your personal and company brand. But most importantly — provide a good product, as the image must be backed up by quality.</li></ol>

<p>Startups are great, as they help great ideas become innovative products that reshape the world we live in. However, quite many startups fail due to falling into one of the 3 major legal pitfalls. Read on to learn what these pitfalls are and how can you avoid getting in them.</p>



<p>Without much ado, the key legal dangers that hide in murky startup waters are as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Working without written contractual obligations</li><li>Unknowingly violating someone’s intellectual property rights or patents</li><li>Unfair competition.</li></ol>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these dangers and how you can deal with them.</p>



<h2>Working without written contractual obligations</h2>



<p>Many entrepreneurs draw helping hands from their friends and relatives at the beginning of their startup journey. You know these people well, they are your homies and drinking buddies, they’ve seen you in good and bad times — you can trust them, right? So, if they can invest money/time/skills and help your product take off, you promise them a hefty reward in equity or a share of revenues if everything turns out right — and nothing if you fail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you are close friends, you are quite content with verbal promises and don’t want to waste time and effort sorting out all sorts of details in writing. Most of the time startups fail, so it all comes to nothing, yes. However, what if the stars align and your product or service actually gains the attention of the target audience, is warmly accepted and actually passes the breakeven point heading towards profitability and success?<br><br>There are too many cases when your closest friends and best buddies say this was possible only due to their mission-critical input (most of the time it actually is that way) — and ask for a bigger share. This is a horrible situation when your word is versus theirs and an open conflict can destroy everything you have built so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>SOLUTION</b>: Even if you don’t want to pay for legal consulting at the very beginning of your startup life cycle when money is very tight, you can just google for a suitable Service Agreement template and adjust it to the needs of your particular situation. Make a draft, discuss all the details, and sign two copies to reduce the risk of your partners trying to adjust the deal conditions on the fly.<br><br>As blatantly obvious as it might be, this is actually a step most often neglected by startups. The golden choice here would be actually contracting a legal advisor to craft bespoke contracts for all your co-founders and for-equity contractors. Even if it might seem an excessive precaution, it can save a ton, of time, money and nerves in the long run.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1141" height="595" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ItSvit_3-Legal-Pitfalls_Unknowingly-violating-intellectual-property_2-.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7688" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ItSvit_3-Legal-Pitfalls_Unknowingly-violating-intellectual-property_2-.png 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ItSvit_3-Legal-Pitfalls_Unknowingly-violating-intellectual-property_2--768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></figure>



<h2>Unknowingly violating someone’s intellectual property rights or patents</h2>



<p>Let’s assume you woke up with a great idea about how to make some aspects of our daily life better. You formulated it and googled for a couple of days checking for any mentions of similar ideas or products and found none (or vise versa, found an underserved niche where your product might successfully compete). Thus, you decided to invest a considerable share of your savings (or even money from your friends and relatives) into implementing this idea — and it seems something worthy is coming out of it.<br><br>Your MVP is nearly ready and you begin marketing it to ensure the target audience is aware of your offers and willing to buy once the product is released. Everything seems great until one day you receive an email with a laconic and ominous title: “Cease and desist”. From it, you will know that your brilliant idea happened to occur to another entrepreneur or enterprise executive quite some time ago, they have patented it and their product is also readying to hit the market. Any court of law will side with the party that has its intellectual property rights properly registered and patented, and you risk losing all the time and money invested in your product development, in addition to paying the legal fees for the lost court case.</p>



<p><b>SOLUTION</b>: Googling is not sufficient as a means of checking the background. The IP items and ideas in the process of patenting are not publically available and are not indexed by Google. The only way to ensure you are safe on that front is by hiring an attorney firm to perform a patenting exploration, as they have the right to issue a legal request regarding the patentability of your ideas and solutions. The result of such an inquiry can also serve as proof of your rights in court, should some tricksters decide to steal your product by registering their rights behindhand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1141" height="595" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ItSvit_3-Legal-Pitfalls_Unfair-competition_3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7687" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ItSvit_3-Legal-Pitfalls_Unfair-competition_3.png 1141w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ItSvit_3-Legal-Pitfalls_Unfair-competition_3-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1141px) 100vw, 1141px" /></figure>



<h2>Unfair competition</h2>



<p>The team is the key asset of the business, so let’s say you are able to attract one of the leading sales managers from your competitors and he persuades all his clients to start using your product, using a wealth of insider information and personal relations with them. This way you get a large base of customers in one fell swoop. Isn’t it great? Actually, no.</p>



<p>There is a number of laws and restrictions against “unfair competition” in every country and state, and stealing customers from competitors in a way described above is a legally prosecutable offense. It might also involve breaking the NDA and the IP rights of the previous employer, so good professionals will not do it anyway. However, what to do if you have indeed recruited a specialist that was previously employed with your competitor?<br><br><b>SOLUTION</b>: Make such a person sign an agreement that explicitly prohibits using insider information for unfair competition. This way, they either follow the fair play rules or if they infringe them — it is their legal problem, not yours.</p>



<h2>Conclusions: avoid these 3 pitfalls and succeed!</h2>



<p>As you can see, any startup might face these 3 challenges on its way to success. However, if you are prudent and cautious, you will face them prepared. Forewarned, forearmed, as the saying goes.</p>



<p>IT Svit follows these rules as we sign SLA, NDA and other legal agreements with our customers, which ensures both parties can safely fulfill their contractual obligations.

<p>There are quite a lot of things that must fall in line before your startup can safely pass the breakeven point and start scaling up. As the common saying in the entrepreneur community goes, you need a hustler (sales rep), a hipster (designer) and a hacker (coder) to make a product. However, if your startup lacks legal expertise, all the great results delivered by the rest of the team might go to waste. Read on to learn about 5 aspects of your business that must be covered by a lawyer to ensure you are on the safe side.</p>



<p>Well, you might say, I will hire a lawyer once I need one, but at the very beginning of my startup journey, I have more important things than legal coverage to invest money in. To that, we can answer with a quote from the Holy Bible, Matthew 7:24-27 — “He who listens and puts this advice into practice is like a man that builds his house on the rock. And he, who does not listen, builds his house on the sand”. When you understand the lawyer is needed, all the possible mistakes are usually already made, and the lawyer can’t help you avoid them. Naturally, avoiding a mistake is much better than rectifying its consequences — both in terms of spending money and time.</p>



<p>Thus, there are 5 crucial aspects of your business that should be covered legally:</p>



<ol><li>Equity sharing and revenue sharing conflicts.</li><li>NDAs, SLAs, employment contracts</li><li>Patenting and IP rights, trademarks and copyright</li><li>Relations with contractors and partners</li><li>Compliance with regulatory legislation&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Let’s look into each of these challenges in more detail.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1140" height="595" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ItSvit_startup-needs_Equity-sharing_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7674" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ItSvit_startup-needs_Equity-sharing_2.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ItSvit_startup-needs_Equity-sharing_2-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></figure>



<h2>Equity sharing and profit-sharing conflicts</h2>



<p>Startup founders live and breathe their ideas, they are absolutely committed to making their businesses successful. However, co-founders, CTOs and the rest of C-level executives are rarely as committed, and their level of effort input might degrade with time. Nevertheless, if the startup is able to take off and becomes profitable, the disputes regarding the importance of every individual’s input are quite common. Every member of C-suite can rightfully say that their personal commitment was instrumental in achieving success and demand more equity or a bigger share of profits.</p>



<p><b>SOLUTION</b>: Hiring a lawyer to write out the legal operating agreements and determine the shares of revenues and equity for each of the founders is the best way to prevent them from demanding to adjust their shares in the future. It might seem an unfriendly move, but it prevents an insanely huge amount of conflicts — and these agreements can be adjusted by mutual agreement later down the track if you find this to be a better choice.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1140" height="595" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ItSvit_startup-needs_NDAs-SLAs_3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7673" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ItSvit_startup-needs_NDAs-SLAs_3.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ItSvit_startup-needs_NDAs-SLAs_3-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></figure>



<h2>NDAs, SLAs, employment contracts</h2>



<p>Relations with employees can be as tangled as with other founders and even more complex, as they are much less motivated to work with their sweat and tears to achieve your result. However, front-end and back-end developers and DevOps engineers are as essential for startup success as CTOs, Sales reps and Team Leads. Finding good specialists is hard in a competitive startup niche. Making such individuals true A-players and team members is even harder — and if your employees leave, they can endanger all the project outcomes.</p>



<p>Most importantly, they might potentially disclose some key information regarding your project that your competitors can tun against you. Preventing this seems pretty simple — just make them sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement when hiring them, right? There are lots of free templates available on the web, take one of them, adapt to your needs, and&#8230; Wrong. If a competitor and your ex-employee are willing to cooperate, they will hire a lawyer that will be able to find loopholes in your home-made NDAs (be it incorrect wording or missing paragraphs with key information) and abuse the situation.</p>



<p><b>SOLUTION</b>: Yes, it is that simple — hire a lawyer! A professional will be able to formulate all the statements correctly and adapt the NDAs and employment contracts to your unique case, ensuring your position is watertight in case of any disputes with your employees. Note, we are not even talking about a full-time hire of a lawyer — a one-time job will do, but this investment can save you a world of pain in the future.</p>

<h2>Patenting and IP rights, trademarks and copyright</h2>



<p>There is nothing worse for a fledgling startup than to find itself being accused of copyright infringement, violation of IP and patent rights, or trademarks. Startups usually do their best to ensure they don’t violate any IP rights before they start developing their products — well, you did google for all the topics related to your latest project before starting it, yeah?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, most startups think they can license and patent anything they build when the need for it becomes obvious. Unfortunately, when such a need becomes obvious, it is usually too late to patent anything, as you have a lawsuit for IP violation on your hands.</p>



<p><b>SOLUTION</b>: you guessed it — hire a lawyer to do a background check. Registered lawyers can issue requests into patenting bureaus of your country and run other IP and trademark researches to ensure you are green to go with your brand name, product idea and design, marketing slogans and other aspects of a successful project. This takes time and money, yes — but these expenses are nowhere near as high as losing in the court of law and having to shut down your entire startup due to the infringement of someone’s patent or IP rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides, doing such a background check preemptively provides you with a proof that at the time you decided to patent your trademark and product idea, they were free for the taking. This can be extremely handy later on, should some competitors decide to file a lawsuit that you infringed their lawful rights. The early bird gets the worm, you know, so the faster you patent your products and ideas — the better for you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1140" height="595" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ItSvit_startup-needs_Relations-with_5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7671" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ItSvit_startup-needs_Relations-with_5.png 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ItSvit_startup-needs_Relations-with_5-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></figure>



<h2>Relations with contractors and partners</h2>



<p>Many companies go for outsourcing certain services (mostly for IT outsourcing of software development and DevOps operations) to cut their costs and shorten the time-to-value for their projects. Such commitments must be legally regulated to protect both parties. For example, IT Svit, which is one of the leading Managed DevOps Services Providers worldwide, always sign NDA, SLA and other needed paperwork with all clients to ensure both parties have their rights protected.</p>



<p><b>SOLUTION</b>: Go for legal assistance every time you engage in a contract with a service provider or a potential investor. Having your rights and responsibilities clearly defined for both parties is a huge help in mitigating any risks and solving any potential issues should they arise.</p>



<h2>Compliance with regulatory legislation</h2>



<p>While your startup is undoubtedly your asset and you can manage it the way you like it, if you decide to go for IPO instead of exiting, you should comply with all the legislative and regulatory codes of your country of registration. If you want to trade your shares, they become securities and any operations with them should comply with strict rules. For example, if you decide to present 5% of your equity to your uncle before IPO — you can do it in under a day by adjusting the founding documents at any law firm. But should you decide to do it after IPO — you need to gain the approval of the board of directors and investors, and this can be quite complicated.</p>



<p><b>SOLUTION</b>: Naturally, hire a lawyer. At the IPO stage, when your startup has passed the breakeven point and is successfully growing, a lawyer becomes a necessity, not a luxury to ensure your legal paperwork is in full order. This is essential to ensure no unforeseen legal ramifications derail your IPO and hinder the ongoing growth of your startup.</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>We listed 5 reasons to hire legal assistance for a startup. This is a good decision for safeguarding your business from any hindrances that might be lurking in the unpredictable waters of the startup journey. The most important aspect of this all is working with trustworthy technology partners and contactors and securing your contractual obligations legally. This ensures your interests and rights are properly covered and you get the needed services in time and under budget, ensuring your competitive advantage and helping you succeed on the market.</p>



<p>At least, this is how a partnership with IT Svit works. If you want to experience it firsthand — contact us with your project requirements and we would be glad to help you out!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/your-startup-needs-a-hustler-a-hipster-a-hacker-and-a-lawyer/">Your startup needs a hustler, a hipster, a hacker… and a lawyer</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Everybody can have a bright idea that might turn out to be a good product, even if you lack the money and the technical expertise needed to implement it. You can secure the investment and simply outsource product development and management in operations, so you can concentrate on growing your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we list (in no particular order) 50 startups from Ukraine that turned their ideas into great products and became a global success. Some of these startups outsourced the development of their products, some outsourced marketing, some built their production facilities in China — but the course of action all of them chose was correct.</p>



<p>All of them are known worldwide (though to a different degree) and all of them are listed as Active on Crunchbase, meaning they are still operating profitably. All you need to achieve this is an idea of how to solve a real-world problem (and do it better than the competition) implemented in a functional, easy-to-use and appealing product. Outsourcing helps a great deal with that, due to giving access to a pool of talented specialists, which reduces the time-to-market and development risks for your product, along with supporting its steady future growth.</p>

They were both positive high-quality experiences, though the illustrations were a bit more expensive than going direct.</em><br><em>Generally, IT outsourcing is good in proving an MVP to validate a market that a company isn&#8217;t 100% sure on pursuing. It is also viable for limited scope projects, as opposed to ever-increasing features, and also useful for needs when needing to rapidly scale and have lots of funding.”</em></p><cite>Juke</cite></blockquote>

<p>Electric cars are becoming ever increasingly popular and most of European countries have started banning diesel engines, but what if a gasoline/diesel car owner doesn’t want to exchange his Volkswagen for Tesla or Mercedes? Titan-Electro offers a solution! This startup operates a network of upgrade car shops, which replace the internal combustion engines with custom electric-powered carriages able to make 200-400 km on a single charge (based on the road conditions and traffic intensity).</p>



<p>The startup also offers a software for tracking a fleet of such vehicles, which is extremely useful for small logistics and delivery companies. Founded by Rob Shaver et al in 2017, this startup was able to raise more than $500k and is already successfully operating in the US.</p>

<p>Toddlers grow so fast they outgrow their clothes and shoes before wearing them out. Besides, lots of wares for kids are needed for several months only, and they remain practically new — so why not sell them again? This idea has inspired a Ukrainian startup Klumba (flowerbed) to build a marketplace for selling/buying new and used items of clothing, shoes and various other wares for kids.

<p>Work from home has ceased to concern exclusively freelancers and has become commonplace for many businesses. Sometimes, remote work is a necessary measure. For example, part of the team is located in another city or your office is currently under repair/ relocation. Alternatively, the government might issue a quarantine and everyone needs to work temporarily from home.</p>



<p>Sometimes, an employee just needs to stay home for various reasons —&nbsp; he/she is waiting for a courier, is sick or does not want to get to the office in a snowstorm — not to mention IT outsourcing, when certain members of your team are locate outside of your office. In any case, it is important for the company to understand how to organize remote work for its employees and whether it is worth including remote work and outsourcing at all as a permanent option in the company.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Itsvit_Remote-work_pros-and-cons_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7408"/></figure>



<h2>The main pros of remote work and outsourcing</h2>



<p>The biggest plus of IT outsourcing and working with remote employees for the company is, of course, cost savings. You do not need to equip a workplace for them and pay for various other expenses, from renting additional office premises and equipment to paying utility bills and purchasing coffee with cookies. Plus, with such employees, it is more often possible to agree on piecework pay. In this case, you will not pay the rate every month, but will only pay for the tasks performed post-factum. This approach excludes the payment for prolonged coffee breaks and conversations in the smoking room.</p>



<p>The main benefit of IT outsourcing in this regard is the culture and established process of working with remote customers. Thus said, once the team implements and accepts daily reports, collaboration through VCS, project tracking systems like JIRA, YouTrack or Trello and communication through chats, where they work from becomes irrelevant.</p>



<p>Thus said IT Svit is one of the leading Managed Services Providers worldwide and among the leaders of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine. Over 10+ years of providing remote software development and 5+ years of delivering managed DevOps services allowed us to establish and polish remote communication processes. This way, now, when most businesses need to adjust to the quarantine, IT Svit just switched the whole team to working remotely and continues to perform our obligations as efficiently as ever.</p>



<p>What other benefits are there in working remotely with an experienced IT outsourcing provider?</p>



<ul><li><b>Instant access to a large pool of skills</b>. It might be hard to find some specific talent locally, especially if your company is not located in a major startup hub (and especially in the situation of quarantine). Quite the contrary, working with IT outsourcing provider grants instant access to teams of skilled professionals.</li><li><b>Professional teams</b>. Finding a talent does not equal to succeeding with the project. Forming a team out of multiple individuals takes time and effort, even more so in the situation of quarantine. Outsourcing your project to IT Svit helps with this too, as we house ready teams with polished processes, who can start working on your tasks at once and deliver value from day one.</li><li><b>Communication simplicity</b>. IT Svit provides remote work and IT outsourcing services to US and EU businesses for more than a decade. Our Sales Managers, Project Managers, and Team Leads are experienced professionals with fluent or Upper- Intermediate English proficiency. They will be able to easily understand your project requirements and transform them into precise specifications, so you can rule out the miscommunication possibility.</li><li><b>Operational efficiency</b>. Over the years we have accomplished a multitude of projects and have faced multiple typical challenges. This allowed us to gather a library of ready solutions and scenarios for most common tasks, which means we are able to provide much shorter time-to-value for your products.</li><li><b>Overlapping time zones</b>. IT Svit is headquartered in New York with R&amp;D center in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Our time zone is GTC+2, meaning our work hours overlap with most of the EU and for at least several hours a day — with various parts of the US. We are always online when you need us and respond promptly to all requests and inquiries.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>This is just a brief overview of the benefits your business gets when working remotely with a reliable IT outsourcing provider like IT Svit. But these benefits are quite often mentioned by multiple IT outsourcing companies, who are used to working remotely. What about organizing the remote work of your team, as you would naturally like to minimize the disruption to your normal operations?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Itsvit_Remote-work_Organizing_3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7409"/></figure>



<h2>Organizing remote work for your team</h2>



<p>Naturally, the companies that interact with their customers offline have to ensure adequate safety measures — or shut down or the quarantine period. However, worldwide quarantine is the time of opportunity for companies that interact with their customers online, and if you are such a business — organizing productive remote work is your highest priority. Nobody wants to sit idly with their hands on their laps — especially if you can spend the time actively growing your customer base!</p>



<p>In addition, as the quarantine situation is not likely to end quickly, the faster you are able to start moving at full speed again, the more likely you are to win the competition race.</p>



<p>Thus said, you will need to ensure your employees are able to contact each other, keep track of the tasks and report on their progress when working remotely. Luckily, most of modern IT tools are freely accessible from any device if you have a login and a password, so using them from home will be as easy as using them from the office for your staff. This includes the following:</p>



<ul><li>messengers like Slack,&nbsp;</li><li>issue tracking/project management systems like Jira or Trello,&nbsp;</li><li>Version Control Systems like Git,&nbsp;</li><li>Human Resource Management tools (Hurma System, BambooHR, Zoho People, etc.)&nbsp;</li><li>corporate Learning Management Systems (Open edX, Blackboard, Moodle, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>The exception are the Intranet platforms and other tools that are bound to certain IP addresses, as they will require your employees to configure VPN access from their home networks.<br><br>However, growing your product or service quickly can require adding more talent to your team, and remote recruitment/adaptation are quite hard (and nearly impossible during quarantine). This is when working with Managed Services Providers like IT Svit becomes even more beneficial — we provide end-to-end solutions, meaning we, most likely, already have the skills you need.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Itsvit_Remote-work_HR-work-remotely_4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7410"/></figure>



<h2>Pitfalls of remote work</h2>



<p>What pitfalls, besides changing the type of communication, can you expect? The most terrible challenges that can be encountered while working&nbsp; remotely are procrastination and distractions. Someone is perfectly concentrated at home, while another person is constantly distracted. If you or some of your employees working from home have a large family or small children who constantly distract from work, remote employment will become quite trying.</p>



<p>Regarding procrastination, there are a couple of tips that can help both you and your staff.</p>



<p>To get started, organize your workplace. Remote workers and freelancers who work in bed and feel great are very rare. When you have separate recreation and work areas, it is much easier to get together and tune in to tasks. Such zoning can be carried out even in one room. Make sure that the desktop is used exclusively for work, and all other areas in the house or apartment — for other activities.</p>



<p>As for distraction — you need your employees to explain to their families that they don’t chill at home — they work remotely now, and they are still as good as absent from 9 to 5 (they just can spend more time with the family in the morning and in the evening, as they don’t have to commute now).</p>



<h2>Conclusions: remote work is the new norm</h2>



<p>As you can see, you can safely let your employees and yourself work from home if this does not negatively affect productivity and you have discussed and planned all the issues related to work, schedule and necessary equipment. Everything is solved with the help of automation and the Internet. Thanks to modern technology, working from home can be not only enjoyable, but also no less productive than in an office.</p>



<p>The same goes to outsourcing. Having a reliable technology partner can be a significant advantage for your business — as you will still be able to get things done, while your competitors won’t. This way, the quarantine will not mean monetary and productivity losses for your business, as you will be able to accomplish all the tasks on time.</p>



<p>We have planned for contingency like quarantine from the start and are proud that our team works stably, allowing our customers to remain operational and productive. IT Svit was able to transition our whole team to work from home without issues during the COVID-19 quarantine — and we can help accomplish your projects on time!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/remote-work-the-new-norm-in-the-changing-world/">Remote work: the new norm in the changing world</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are various reasons for IT outsourcing, as businesses can delegate some tasks to reliable contractors and concentrate on core expertise instead. Ukraine is a long-term partner and one of the most preferable IT outsourcing destinations for the EU and US businesses. In 2020, another compelling reason for Ukrainians to work at home is the ever-strengthening currency, as Ukrainian hryvnya has strengthened 19% in 2019.</p>



<p>The benefits of working with an IT outsourcing company for an EU or US business are numerous:</p>



<ul><li>instant access to a pool of highly skilled software engineers,&nbsp;</li><li>significant reduction of time-to-market for new product features,&nbsp;</li><li>reduction of risks related to software development, like tighter deadlines,</li><li>higher software development quality (fewer mistakes and bugs),&nbsp;</li><li>lower expenses on salaries and infrastructure operations,</li><li>legal coverage due to SLA and NDA.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ItSvit_2020_list_2-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7246"/></figure>



<p>This applies to work with any IT services provider across the globe, though. Why do we say Ukraine is the best choice for finding a reliable IT outsourcing partner?</p>



<ul><li><b>A huge pool of skilled talents</b>. Ukraine has a fairly developed system of higher education and many universities there produce students with a high level of theoretical technology knowledge. Later, these people become Junior IT specialists and quickly grow into Middle and Seniors. According to estimates from DOU, the leading Ukrainian IT-related portal, there are approximately 160,000 software developers and DevOps engineers in Ukraine as of 2019.</li><li><b>Large number of experienced professionals</b>. Out of these 160,000 IT specialists, nearly 35% are Juniors and approximately 30% fall to Middle and Senior level talents respectively. Thus said, most of Ukrainian IT outsourcing companies can quickly form the required teams for any project requirements and complexity.</li><li><b>Fluent English</b>. Being the language of international communication, English is extremely important in IT outsourcing. Most Ukrainian IT professionals can speak English fluently or at least at the Intermediate level, which is enough to ensure transparent and frictionless business communication.</li><li><b>Overlapping time zones</b>. The Ukrainian time zone is GMT +2:00, so it mostly overlaps with the EU business time and covers most of the US evening. This makes it very convenient for the US and UK businesses, as the tasks can be done and discussed at once for Europeans or will be done overnight for the US businesses. This speeds up software development considerably.</li><li><b>Cultural fit</b>. Ukraine is a European country with a Westernized culture and mindset, so Ukrainians celebrate Christian religious holidays and these are not too numerous. Thus said, Ukrainian teams have a good cultural fit with the US and EU customers and can ensure the projects roll out according to a schedule.</li><li><b>Polished workflows and ready solutions</b>. Many Ukrainian companies have 5+ years of IT outsourcing expertise under their belts. This means these teams have polished workflows and established processes, which ensures timely delivery of required services and products. Most importantly, while each project is unique, accomplishing multiple similar projects helps identify common challenges and prepare solutions for them. Thus said, experienced IT outsourcing companies in Ukraine can deliver software products and solutions much quicker, as they don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time.</li></ul>



<p>To sum it up, some companies in Ukraine can become one-stop shops for all your IT-related needs and tasks. The companies that can provide the full cycle of IT services for businesses of all sizes are called <a href="https://themanifest.com/it-services/msp/companies">Managed Services Providers</a>, and they are able to deliver end-to-end solutions for various aspects of IT operations — from MVP development and automated QA to seamless software releases and real-time monitoring.</p>



<p>IT Svit is one of such companies and a <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/ukraine/leaders-matrix">leader of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine</a>, so we know the situation in the Ukrainian IT industry firsthand. And we see that 2019 was marked by a significant increase in the variety and quantity of Ukrainian IT outsourcing projects and startups. Grammarly, the world’s most popular grammar checker was one of the <a href="https://www.lift99.co/blog/ukraines-top-startups-launching-the-wall-of-fame">top 15 Ukrainian startups that launched the Wall of Fame in 2019</a>.</p>



<p>Thus said, instead of aiming to relocate to Western European countries, more and more Ukrainians prefer to work and start their business in Ukraine, which is proven by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/world-s-best-performing-currency-cools-ukrainians-lust-to-leave">Bloomberg’s research on the currency strengthening rate in 2019</a>. As hryvnya (UAH), the national currency strengthened 19% in 2019, more jobs became much more competitive in Ukraine and even the specialists that emigrated previously prefer to go back and work in Ukraine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ItSvit_2020_conclusion_3-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7248"/></figure>



<h2>Final thoughts: what does 2020 have in stock for the Ukrainian IT outsourcing business?</h2>



<p>IT Svit develops our own product — <a href="https://hurma.work/en/">HURMA System</a>, an end-to-end platform for recruitment and HR management processes, and it has nearly 400 customers a year after the release. With 80%+ of our customers being IT companies, mostly IT outsourcing providers, we keep the hand on the pulse of the IT industry. A significant portion of our customers has doubled their service packages over this year, meaning their teams grow rapidly — as the numbers of their contracts grow.</p>



<p>We are sure 2020 will continue to bring new partnership possibilities between US and EU businesses and Ukrainian IT outsourcing companies. With the stabilization of the UAH exchange rate and growth of the Ukrainian economy, ever more mutually beneficial contracts are sure to emerge. As for IT Svit, we are always ready to lend our DevOps and software development expertise to a company of any size from any industry to help you reach the business objectives set. Contact us today and let’s start working on your next project tomorrow!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/why-2020-is-a-great-time-for-it-outsourcing-to-ukraine/">Why 2020 is a great time for IT outsourcing to Ukraine</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span id="more-7127"></span>
<!--noteaser-->



<p>Many startups nowadays aim for an IPO — an Initial Public Offering, which is defined by the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/ipo.htm">US SEC</a> (Securities and Exchange Commission) as the first time the company tries to sell its share on a stock exchange publically. It is a decent way to secure the investment needed for the long-term success of your company by selling some minor shares to the public investors without losing control over your business.</p>



<p>However, IPO has two sides, and for an investor, it can be a risky venture, where they must spend some money on a promise of revenue in the future. Therefore, investors want to know they are not buying a cat in a bag, and there is a clearly defined <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/ipo/ipo1.asp#axzz28XBJIRom">procedure of preparing for an IPO</a>:<br></p>



<ol><li><b>Underwriting bank selection</b>. You must hire an investment bank to act as your middle man and raise some capital from public investors and corporations. The better the investment bank’s reputation, the more likely your company is to be positively evaluated.</li><li><b>Negotiations of underwriting terms</b>. You must come to an agreement with the underwriting bank regarding the sum you want to raise, what securities will be issued and what the type of underwriting agreement will be — a firm commitment, where the bank guarantees raising only a certain sum or a best-effort agreement, where the bank will try to raise as much as possible, but does not guarantee the final result.</li><li><b>SEC registration and approval</b>. The underwriting bank fills in the registration papers and SEC must clear your company — check your management background, financial position, possible lawsuits started by you or against you, etc. This is essential to instill confidence in potential public investors.</li><li><b>Initial prospectus publication</b>. While the SEC verifies your company data, the underwriter bank publishes the initial prospectus — a description of what your company is, what is your business model and growth potential and what profits the investors can hope to receive if buying your stock. <br>This prospectus covers the securities you are going to trade, but cannot mention the IPO date or the cost of the shares, so as to build up the hype without giving too much information out. This is the period for attracting large investors, like corporations, investment funds or institutional investors, as they can provide the largest sums, and individual investors can come in later.</li><li><b>Price negotiations</b>. At this stage, your startup and the underwriter must come to an agreement regarding the desired price of your securities. The price is affected by a huge variety of factors, from the results of SEC investigation to the approximate results of hype building up and the overall conditions of the market close to the IPO date.</li><li><b>Start of the trading</b>. Your company begins trading the securities and raises the money needed for further growth… or not.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ItSvit_IPO_list_2-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7128"/></figure>



<h2>Possible dangers of the IPO</h2>



<p>You might have heard the stories of how people woke up multimillionaires or billionaires the next day after their IPO. Stories like that are true and they funnel more and more people into the fray — but the IPO is not covered with rose petals, not by far. </p>



<p>First of all, the IPO is not free. There are quite a lot of regulatory requirements and compliance assessments to be done according to the procedure outlined by the federal government and SEC. The expenditure on these procedures and checks can cost up to $2 million, and if the IPO fails to raise enough interest — this money can be lost for good.</p>



<p>Secondly, the result of the IPO depends largely on the state of your overall business standing and the market situation as a whole. The billionaires we mentioned before were millionaires even before the IPO, and their businesses were growing steadily before (and without) the investments secured during the trading. In other words, you must not bank everything on the IPO, as its proceedings can be insufficient to cover the expenses.</p>



<p>Thirdly, the results of the SEC checks can be quite damaging for the company, especially if you didn’t perform internal security and compliance analysis or financial restructuring for a couple of years. It might turn out that your operations are not secure enough, your market evaluation is inflated or your company performance is endangered by a possible lawsuit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="571" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ItSvit_IPO_chart_4-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7131"/></figure>



<p>For example, Lyft went public in March 2019. It was evaluated at approximately $20 billion and claimed to operate nearly 40% of the car-sharing market. The IPO trading opened at $72 per share and went up to $78 by the end of the day, estimating the company worth $26.6 billion in total. However, once Lyft published the quarterly reports and revealed their losses in March, the cost of their shares plummeted to $45 apiece, and as of November 2019, it stays that way, meaning the company lost nearly 25% of its capital after IPO and is currently evaluated $15 billion only.</p>



<p>Uber decided to go for an IPO too, but the results of Lyft’s failure undermined the market confidence in Uber. While it was evaluated at $120 billion at the end of 2018, the IPO in May has lead to Uber reevaluation, as the company stock traded for $45 apiece, resulting in a $75 billion company value. This is a whopping 38% decrease in company cost, as the investors were deeply concerned with the possible outcome of Uber operations, due to it sharing the business model with Lyft. When the company reported $5.2 billion loss in the second quarter of 2019, Wall Street perceived it as the red flag, and institutional investors tried to get rid of Uber stock, significantly dropping the market cost. Uber shares are currently traded for approx $29 and the cost is steadily dropping.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="571" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ItSvit_IPO_chart_3-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7132"/></figure>



<p>What was the reason for such underwhelming IPO results for Lyft and Uber? As most of the profit from their operations come to the drivers, both companies are essentially cash burners. The mass adoption of driverless cars and the Internet of Things can cut their expenses and make their market costs double or triple — but this is currently years away.</p>



<p>However, not all IPOs of 2019 were disasters. In the 2nd quarter of 2019 Zoom went public along with Pinterest. While Zoom stock was evaluated at $19 apiece, it grew 72% by the end of the IPO and closed at $62 — which resulted in the company value becoming close to $9 billion. Why was that? Because Zoom nearly doubled the number of its users over 2018 and continues to grow steadily month by month.<br><br>Pinterest started trading at $19 and while it did not show such rapid growth, it did increase the total evaluation of the social media by nearly $2 billion, totaling at $12 billion.</p>



<p>As you can see, IPO favors the companies with cost-efficient and secure operations, reliable cloud infrastructure and business model and positive growth expectations. How to make sure your company is perceived this way?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ItSvit_IPO_conclusion_5-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7130"/></figure>



<h2>Strong technical &amp; legal expertise — a solid basis for a successful IPO</h2>



<p>With such an important and complex procedure as the IPO, it is wise to make sure you are on the safe side during discussing and signing the legal papers on all the stages of the process. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you find and hire trustworthy legal representatives to ensure the documents you sign with the underwriting bank and the investors are safe and sound. It is also very prudent to ensure the technical side of your operations is waterproof.<br></p>



<p>Most of the companies that interact with their customers through some web or mobile applications still run the infrastructure they built during the rapid growth phase. This means that growth pangs are quite real, regardless of the size of operations, and the customers can expect service downtime at any moment. Naturally, once SEC publishes such conclusions, the investors won’t be very pleased.<br></p>



<p>The best way to prevent this situation is by performing IT infrastructure assessment and optimization for your business.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The need to hire a dedicated team of developers is one of the biggest challenges for a startup early in its lifecycle. Asking for recommendations from your friends, googling, searching on freelancer sites, searching through social media and LinkedIn, reaching out for MSPs or attending local meetups and hackathons… the choice is up to you, we simply highlight the pros and cons of each approach to hiring a professional software development team.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/hire-dedicated-team-developers-startup/">How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most important part of a successful startup launch is creating a neat and efficient MVP. The main question one has to answer is how to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup?</p>
<p><span id="more-3033"></span></p>
<p>As the startup lifecycle involves investing significant time and resources into developing an MVP, the startups want guarantees of a successful and timely project completion. Hiring a dedicated team of software developers is the basis of a successful product delivery.In a perfect scenario, you already have a dedicated team of software developers who helped you accomplish a bunch of projects and who understand your requirements and expectations. In the real world, you do not have them and have to hire a dedicated development team to turn your project into reality. There are such possible courses of actions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Searching for a dedicated team of developers by recommendation</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Searching for a professional development team on the Internet</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Hiring a software development team through freelancer workplaces</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Contacting a team of software engineers over the social media or LinkedIn</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Hiring a dedicated team for software development from a Managed Services Provider</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Meeting a team of software developers on conferences, meetups, and hackathons</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of these approaches.</p>
<h2>Choosing a dedicated team of developers by a word of mouth</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3041" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_word-of-mouth.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_1" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>The word of mouth and the personal advocacy is the best promotion for any services, including the software development. Some of your relatives, friends or colleagues have definitely used the help of some developers to create a website, launch a web app or deploy a business analytics solution, and can introduce them to you.</p>
<p>However, the important thing to keep in mind is that the technology stack differs much from the mobile app and web development, building a payment gateway or delivering a business analytics solution. Thus said, even if the dedicated software development team in question was able to deliver a great service to your friend, they might not be able to do the same for you… yet they can introduce you to the one who can. Here at IT Svit, we know this is quite an efficient approach, as around 70% of our customers are referred to us by our previous clients and partners.</p>
<h2>Browsing the Internet to hire a dedicated team of developers</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3038" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_Internet.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_3" width="120" height="120" />Many long-standing software development teams offer their services through their landing pages over the Internet. As creation and promotion of websites offering various software development and delivery services require lots of time and effort, the companies who do this should be serious about their jobs. To say even more, if these websites appear on the top SERPs, the teams behind them must be doing their job well.</p>
<p>Try searching for the keywords relevant to your project, like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Dedicated web development services</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Custom-tailored cloud solutions for startups and business</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Building an MVP for startups</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Full-cycle services for startups, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The keywords in your search requests will be related to your project, obviously. The resulting pages will provide the contacts of multiple software development teams or their contacts on industry-specific classified advertisement websites and boards. This might even bring up the reviews from the previous customers of said teams placed on such boards.</p>
<h2>Hiring a freelance team of developers</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3037 alignleft" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_freelance.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_4" width="120" height="120" />Websites like <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/companies/~014d4727e2f42f3042" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Upwork</a> or Freelancer are quite popular freelancer workplaces, where multiple software development teams offer their services. These services vary from web development and mobile app development for iOS and Android to creating custom CRM or corporate eLearning systems, delivering various infrastructure solutions or providing custom development of modules for popular eCommerce platforms.</p>
<p>Trying to hire a reliable team of developers on these websites grants the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Multiple filters allow specifying the search parameters precisely</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Team descriptions hold in-depth details of their experience and the technology stack they use</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">The rating system helps evaluate the reliability of any development team</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">The reviews from other customers help form a holistic view of the team’s performance</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">You can publish a job offer and the team will contact you on their own</li>
</ul>
<p>The drawbacks of this approach include the need to decline multiple job requests from India and the chance of your job offer being reposted under another title and for a lower price, to be given to a subcontractor. Such middlemen spoil the hiring process and you risk getting a subpar quality product that will be delivered overdue.</p>
<p>In addition, God forbid you from trying to form a dedicated team of freelancers yourself to manage the project completion. This is a risky and effort-consuming endeavor highly prone to failure.</p>
<h2>Contacting a dedicated software development team in the social media and on LinkedIn</h2>
<p>One of the most obvious ways to reach out to the software development teams is contacting them through the social media like Facebook and LinkedIn. These resources have thematic groups where these developers can be found. You can post your project description there and ask for help, contacts of the worthy contractors or at least a repost. Your friends and family can do this too — sharing is caring, you know.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3039" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_LinkedIn.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup on LinkedIn" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>The main benefit of searching via LinkedIn is that this social network is built to connect professionals. The specialists post their portfolios there, specify their skills, and the level of their endorsements shows their overall efficiency at their job — or great soft skills <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> To say even more, many managed services providers maintain their presence on LinkedIn and can be contacted through there. Just search for the keywords relevant to your requirements and select Companies filter to get the list of potential contractors. Browse through the results, assess the companies and contact the CEO or CTO of the most promising contractor!</p>
<h2>Hiring a dedicated team of developers from an MSP</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3040" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_MSP.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_2" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>Using all the aforementioned methods of searching for a reliable team of developers you will often see the contacts of Managed Services Provider companies (MSPs). These firms specialize in the development of any kind of software and apps and their ongoing support. You might happen to notice the same companies on the Internet, mentioned by your acquaintances, listed on various work marketplaces, business ads boards and on the social media.</p>
<p>By analyzing the search results you can make the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">If the company website appears on the 1-2 Google result page on the searches relevant to your project, the company has invested heavily in the correct SEO promotion.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">If the website appears for many keywords, the company has built the right marketing and SEO strategy — and will be able to do this for your startup as well.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">If the company website has a sleek and nice-looking website with intuitive design, easy navigation and fast performance, the products of this company will likely have the same features.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">If the company website contains sufficient quantities of completed business cases and finished projects, along with a positive feedback from satisfied customers, the company really possesses a good stack of skills and experience, allowing it to complete your project on time and with reliable quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same goes the other way. If the company website looks untidy, has complex navigation and malfunctioning buttons on various pages, it’s better to avoid dealing with such a company for good. Otherwise, you risk receiving the same flaws for the product they develop for you. In addition, aside from reading the positive feedback on the website, try searching for additional reviews and feedback over the Internet. Negative reviews help form a holistic picture of the company, don’t they?</p>
<h2>Meeting a dedicated team of software developers at conferences, meetups, and hackathons</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3035" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_conference.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_6" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>In order to remain competitive, the software developers should always continue their self-education and professional growth. This is why good software development teams often participate in various conferences, meetups, and hackathons, which are well-covered in the mass media and social media. Attend such events in your city — or neighboring IT hubs. Talk with the participants, and they will either be able to help you or will point you in the right direction. To say even more, you will be able to see the efficiency of the team’s work on the hackathon.</p>
<p>The drawbacks of this approach are the same as with the word of mouth recommendations. You might find a great dedicated team of software developers that just does not have the needed skills to make your project a reality.</p>
<h2>How to evaluate a dedicated software development team then?</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3036" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 0;" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dedicated-team-of-developers-for-a-startup_evaluation.jpg" alt="How to hire a dedicated team of developers for a startup_5" width="120" height="120" /></p>
<p>We recommend combining all the aforementioned approaches. You will obviously not hire the first team you find, as the software development lifecycle of your product will cost several dozen thousand dollars, and you need to hire the most reliable team of developers to invest the money right. Shortlist 3-4 software development teams, evaluate their skill stacks, portfolio, website quality and positioning, feedback from their previous customers.</p>
<p>Note the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Company experience</b>. We do not recommend delegating complex or costly projects to young teams with less than 2-3 years of experience. Such teams either lack the needed experience or might fall apart amidst your project, leaving it in debris.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Staff size</b>. The teams with 10 members or less are usually highly-specialized. This means there is nobody to replace the crucial team member should he or she become ill or leave altogether. We recommend working with the MSPs who are at least 30-40 men strong to ensure the project continuity and timely completion.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Company portfolio</b>. Contact the previous customers of this company. Find out if they were satisfied with the project management and product development, team interaction and feedback response. The real reviews are the best proof of quality, and if the team has already successfully developed the products for startups — they will be able to provide high-quality services and workflows for you.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Product quality</b>. Ask the company to provide the examples of working products and solutions they developed, or try to use the services of the previous customers. If their products are intuitive, performant and work fast — this software development team really can deliver a high-quality product.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><b>Company website</b>. Ask the third-party specialist to evaluate the chosen team’s website. Aside from a good design, it must be functional, intuitive and well-optimized. If the team cannot do it for their own website — they will hardly be able to provide these qualities for your product.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final thoughts on how to hire a reliable team of developers for a startup on your own</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are quite a few ways to hire a reliable team of developers on your own. You can opt for searching through word of mouth recommendations, exploring the Internet on your own, trying to use the popular freelancer workplaces like Upwork and Freelancer, look on the social media and LinkedIn, go for contracting a Managed Service Provider or reaching out to the participants of various conferences, meetups and hackathons.</p>
<p>We understand the process might seem too daunting and laborious. However, it is obviously better to spend more time to hire a reliable team of software developers for your startup and accomplish the project on time. Otherwise, you risk spending the time and money dealing with an inexperienced or unscrupulous contractor.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>We have to evaluate the costs of launching an online retail shop or developing a web application quite often. We summarized our experience on the matter and highlighted the hidden fees, money saving tricks and possible risks in this article.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/true-costs-of-launching-an-online-retail-website-for-startups/">True Costs Of Launching An Online Retail Website for Startups</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launching your first website can be a daunting perspective for any entrepreneur. Thus said, this should be an informed decision, made after finding out all the possible circumstances.</p>
<p><span id="more-2963"></span></p>
<p>There are two main types of websites: informative and interactive. Informative websites contain mostly static information with limited interaction capabilities (blogs, forums, personal websites, business websites, etc.) Interactive websites contain dynamic content with rich interaction capabilities (news websites, video-streaming services, online shops, picture galleries, etc.)</p>
<p>There are lots of website builders available, which help create a website for free. These CMS’s and platforms include WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, etc. Nevertheless, their out-of-the-box functionality is pretty limited, additional plugins and add-ons might be bulky for customization and management. In addition, intense custom module development might be needed to make the website comply with your individual requirements, not to mention frequent news of loopholes and security flaws discovered within them, or the fact the number of (really good looking) templates is limited.</p>
<p>There are certain ways to save money using these website building platforms:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Use the templates to build a free website fast</b>. The platforms like WooCommerce, Magento, Shopify and others offer a variety of hosting options (from platform hosted websites to deploying your website to your custom hosting), and you can adjust the functionality the way you need.</li>
<li><b>Gather the following</b>. Reach out to the people, offer your services, ask if you can be of any help, answer their questions, provide real support. Not a single shiny ads campaign can earn you the respect and loyalty of your audience. Dedicated support can.</li>
<li><b>Market your products or services online</b>. Social media provide a great way to talk to your potential customers in person, at the time most convenient for them and provide all the details they might require. Avoid spending on printed ads, radio commercials and anything else from the brick-and-mortar shopping era. You sell the goods online and should advertise them online.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus said, these free websites can serve a couple of important goals for a startup:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;">They can help grow your customer audience and ensure the startup viability by generating some income</li>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;">They can help you make a list of requirements for your custom-tailored website</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you know what features and functionality you (and your customers) require from a website, it’s time to build your bespoke eCommerce website from scratch. This way you will be able to provide a unique design, functionality and user experience your customers would love.</p>
<p><a href="https://itsvit.com/contacts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2965 size-full" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Launching_a_Website_for_Startups_ITSvit_1.jpg" alt="True Costs Of Launching An Online Retail Website for Startups_1" width="1200" height="628" /></a></p>
<p>There are certain bad practices one should avoid at all costs while building a website. Keep them in mind and don’t fall for the fallacy of best intentions, family ties or friendly help:</p>
<p><b>Don’t mix family and business</b>. Unless your relative becomes your business partner or an employee, don’t ask them to build a website for you. Building a website implies multiple ongoing costs (hosting issues, maintenance, updating the modules, backups, and restoration, etc.). Unless you employ your relative full-time, asking for such a help would only ruin both your business and your family ties.</p>
<p><b>Don’t try to save on development by employing interns</b>. We all know software development, as well as website or web app development, might be expensive. In an attempt to save some money some startups opt for employing interns. Both sides seem to win from such agreement — the interns add some projects to their portfolio, while the startup saves a ton of money on salary. The downside of this approach is that if (or, to be correct, when) something goes wrong — you will have to find and hire the website original developer — or hire a company to deal with the issue, while your website is down.How to save money then? Outsourcing is the route the majority of businesses go, as the developers overseas might be as skilled at the domestic talents while costing significantly less. In addition, such managed services providers usually provide the full-cycle services for startups, including the product development, QA, maintenance, updates, scaling, and marketing promotion.<br />
<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2968" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Launching_a_Website_for_Startups_ITSvit_4.jpg" alt="True Costs Of Launching An Online Retail Website for Startups_4" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
There are but two concerns to have in mind: large development companies issue large checks and the cheapest product is never the high-quality one.<br />
<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2970 size-full" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Launching_a_Website_for_Startups_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="True Costs Of Launching An Online Retail Website for Startups_2" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
Here is the approximate spread of product quality depending on the development team location.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2967" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Launching_a_Website_for_Startups_ITSvit_3.jpg" alt="True Costs Of Launching An Online Retail Website for Startups_3" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p><b>Don’t stockpile the goods in advance</b>. The biggest advantage of eCommerce is that you are the medium between a customer and a manufacturer. You do not need to have a full warehouse of goods to sell them. Instead, you form a daily shopping cart and pay as it goes, while receiving payments from your customers. Have only as much as needed in stock to avoid paying the warehousing expenses.</p>
<p>Thus said, the best choice for launching an online retail shop for startups is outsourcing the job to a reputable managed services provider, which will deliver the high-quality project on time, have you covered with an in-depth SLA, provide 24/7 support and help your startup scale on request. This approach can help you <b>save up to 70% on development</b> without compromising on the quality! Affordable rates allow paying for time and resources spent on development while transparent project management ensures you are always in control of the process.</p>

		<title>Trust or caution? Importance of NDA for Startups</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Trusting your startup idea to another can seem a nightmare, yet sometimes it is a vital step to the idea implementation as a successful startup. NDA can help an entrepreneur to stay on the safe side with their employees, yet mentioning an NDA to a VC investor is not the brightest idea. Want to know why it is so? Read our latest article!</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/trust-caution-importance-nda-startups/">Trust or caution? Importance of NDA for Startups</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NDA is one of the main judicial instruments of a startup, both a shield and a sword. Just keep in mind, the importance of NDA for startups is a double-edged sword. Why do we think so?</p>
<p><span id="more-2669"></span></p>
<p>First of all, don’t get us wrong, signing a <b>NDA is great</b> for certain aspects of startup workflow. It is a legally binding document that safeguards the entrepreneur’s intellectual property in terms of securing the product idea from unwanted divulgation. Thus said, every startup employee or contractor MUST sign an NDA to ensure the entrepreneur is on the safe side if any litigation takes place.</p>
<p>Hiring an accountant that will know the sources of income, expected profits and growth projections? Seal their lips with NDA to ensure the competition cannot evaluate your potential and undermine your success.<br />
Working with an external contractor, like hiring a DevOps-as-a-Service or hiring a software development team to access the pool of talents your fresh team does not possess yet? NDA is an absolute must, which is why all IT Svit contract agreements and SLA have NDA as their part. Taking caution by signing an NDA is a protective shield no startup should neglect. However, sometimes it can be a dangerous weapon against the startup. Why so?</p>
<h2>VC firms hate NDA’s</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2671 size-full" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Importance_Of_NDA_ITSvit_1.jpg" alt="Importance_of_NDA_For_Startups_1" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>The main fear of many entrepreneurs is that the VC will steal their idea and give it to some other startup that will provide a shorter time to market and reap all the benefits. This is least likely to happen, actually, and here is why. A Venture Capitalist is usually the person who walked quite a long path atop the business world. They had their share of bright ideas, sleepless nights, overdue product releases and overnight fixes — and trust us, they DO NOT want to enter this river again.</p>
<p>What they actually WANT is <b>MAKING MONEY</b> and the best part of it is THEY DO NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING to get their money. Startups come to VC firms with their ideas (sometimes with working Proofs of Concept and a carcass of a future product team) — and a VC has to evaluate 500-2000 ideas ANNUALLY, sometimes 3 to 7 A DAY. They simply <b>do not have time to read and sign an NDA</b>, nor do they want to hire a dedicated legal department team to keep track of all of these documents.</p>
<p>Instead, a VC firm simply evaluates the idea and the resources the startup has. If the investor finds the idea welcoming, they provide the finances and reap their benefits in due time. Most importantly, the VC firms never stop investing in <b>MULTIPLE</b> startups, so they have their portfolio spread out to minimize the impact of potential losses if a product nosedives. Thus said, keeping a steady flow of deals is essential, as 10 ideas are better than 5, and if signing an NDA prohibits the VC to discuss any idea related to the product, they essentially shut the doors for all the future potential deals related to this idea. Not a single VC will do this, obviously.</p>
<p>IT Svit quite often provides <a href="https://itsvit.com/startups/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">startup consulting services</a> or helps the entrepreneurs to deliver the Proof of Concept or build an MVP. We also introduce the startups to VC firms and this is where we warn our partners not to mention NDA at all if they want to secure the investment.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on the importance of NDA for startups</h2>

<p>As you can see, while it is wise for a startup to exercise caution and sign an NDA with all their employees and contractors, VC firms must be left out of this equation. If you still think the VC will want to steal your idea and give it to another team to turn it into a product — you are very deeply mistaken about the ways the VC actually works.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other ways of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ico-future-startup-funding/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">securing a startup funding</a>, allowing to avoid working with VC firms altogether. Mayhaps, this is the course of action to take if you do not trust the sharks of business. But if you are after traditional ways and want to get funding from the VC firms, all you need to launch a startup is a bright idea, a working Proof of Concept or MVP, and a team at the ready to create the full-scale product. This is exactly what IT Svit provides to our partners.</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/trust-caution-importance-nda-startups/">Trust or caution?
