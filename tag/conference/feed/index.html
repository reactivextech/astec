					<description><![CDATA[<p>A brief review and analysis of recent AWS re:Invent 2018 conference. At a glance: AWS dedicates significant effort to augmenting all of their products and services with AI, ML. Big Data analytics and blockchain features. This will allow AWS customers to become more efficient and drive more value to their clients.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-reinvent-2018-brief-review/">AWS re: Invent 2018 — a brief review</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AWS re:Invent is an annual conference held at the end of November, announcing and describing all the innovations AWS has developed through the year. Let’s see what is in stock for 2019.</p>
<p><span id="more-4889"></span></p>
<p>Last year we covered the introduction of AWS Fargate and Aurora, the new generation of EC2 instances, the updates to Glacier and other AWS products announced during <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/new-aws-tech-introduced-aws-reinvent-2017/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS re:Invent 2017</a>. The general summary of this year’s conference is as follows: AWS is living up to their promise made at <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-summit-2018-london-highlights-takeaways/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS Summit 2018 London</a>: to invest heavily into augmenting the cloud offers with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data Analytics features.</p>
<p>The company announced over 20 new AI/ML offers and updates to the existing services, as well as managed blockchain development tools. Below is a brief overview of new AWS features, services, and products presented during the AWS re:Invent 2018 week.</p>
<h2><span id="releases">Integration</span> with Microsoft FS and Lustre</h2>
<p>AWS has long since supported Microsoft Active Directory and workplaces. The next step is enabling to run Windows File Server infrastructure on AWS hardware and integrate it with other AWS products in your account. The introduction of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/aws/new-amazon-fsx-for-windows-file-server-fast-fully-managed-and-secure/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon FSx for Windows File Server</a> enables the corporations that have invested heavily in their Windows-based ecosystem to move to AWS nearly effortless, lifting-and-shifting their existing structures and workloads without the need to rebuild them from scratch. This option is also available for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-fsx-for-lustre/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lustre</a> and ensures cross-compatibility, security, granular control, ease of management and high tunability of the infrastructure. The service can be configured to work at 2,048 Mb/second throughput with systems as big as 64 TB.</p>
<h2>Pay-on-Demand as an alternative to PAYG for DynamoDB</h2>
<p>DynamoDB is a great tool for cloud architects, providing multi-region table location, multi-master configuration, in-memory caching, encryption at rest, point-in-time recovery, etc. However, when the size of the read/write traffic cannot be predicted, one must either plan for capacity and enable auto-scaling, or risk lags.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4892" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_AWS_re_Invent_2018_keynote.jpg" alt="IT Svit review: AWS re:Invent 2018 - keynote" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>Pay-on-Demand is a new approach to the configuration of DynamoDB performance. The introduction of a pay-on-demand billing model enables the following use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of serverless apps running under the pay-per-use billing</li>
<li>Testing new apps, whose database workload is hard to predict</li>
<li>Deploying a separate data table per customer for independent SaaS providers</li>
</ul>
<p>While this billing model does not support auto-scaling, it provides a great way to save money by minimizing the number of resources actually consumed. AWS customers can switch between different capacity planning modes while creating their tables or once per day in production.</p>
<h2>Deep Learning acceleration with Elastic Inference from AWS</h2>
<p>AWS has been actively imbuing their AI/ML services using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GPU capabilities of P3 instances</a>. A single Amazon P3 has the immense power of 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUS and operates on the scale of up to 1 PetaFLOP. A decade ago such power was available only with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Roadrunner" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IBM supercomputer</a> — now it is here for any data scientist to use.</p>
<p>However, rigid instance parameters quite often mean overpayment, as finding the balance between the CPU, RAM, and the required volume of GPU power is quite hard. AWS thought of the way to rectify such a discrepancy and introduced the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elastic-inference-gpu-powered-deep-learning-inference-acceleration/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Elastic Inference feature</a>, allowing the developers and admins to attach exactly the required quantity of GPU power to their Deep Learning projects. Flexibility instead of pre-defined capacities is a great improvement for all AI/ML projects running on AWS.</p>
<h2><span id="sagemaker">Amazon SageMaker</span> updates: Ground Truth and Managed RL</h2>
<p>One of the biggest efforts and investments involved in the process of training a Machine Learning model under a supervised learning approach is labeling the data. There are services like <a href="https://www.mturk.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon mTurk</a>, there are public datasets like <a href="http://www.image-net.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ImageNet</a>, <a href="https://research.google.com/youtube8m/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">YouTube-8M</a>, <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MNIST</a>, there is the manual labeling approach — yet open datasets might turn out to be irrelevant for your case while hiring enough workforce yourself can be too costly or too long.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4890" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_AWS_re_Invent_2018_AI_ML.jpg" alt="IT Svit review: AWS re:Invent 2018 -- AI &amp; ML" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>This is why Amazon SageMaker now provides the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/sagemaker/groundtruth/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ground Truth</a> — a new feature allowing to utilize Machine Learning to label the data needed to train your Machine Learning model! The point is — when SageMaker is confident the labels are correct — it labels the raw data itself. If human intervention is required (the images are too complicated for the model to label, for example) — the images are sent to human attention for labeling. After they are labeled, they are sent back to the model, further improving its efficiency. Applying GroundTruth can <b>cut your AWS SageMaker dataset training expenses by 70%</b>.</p>
<p>Another new SageMaker feature announced during the event is the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/features/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Managed Reinforced Learning</a>. Reinforced learning is an approach to ML model training when the algorithm is rewarded by human-defined functions for making the right decisions. This helps the algorithm to develop the right approach to decision-making for the tasks that are more difficult than telling a cat from a dog. Leveraging the Amazon SageMaker RL feature <b>drastically lowers the time</b> needed to train your ML model.</p>
<p>In addition, AWS Marketplace solutions range was increased with more than <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/solutions/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">150 ready-made Machine Learning models</a>. These can be bought and configured by any AWS customer, enabling multiple use cases in retail, manufacturing, media and other categories — and the list grows daily.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/aws/amazon-personalize-real-time-personalization-and-recommendation-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon Personalize</a> — engage your audiences through Amazon-built recommendation engine solution. The AutoML algorithm combines 20 years of Amazon experience to automatically deploy, train and run ML models of your choice and work with datasets stored at Amazon S3 or with streaming data sent from your systems live.</p>
<h2><span id="conclusions">Final thoughts</span> on AWS re:Invent 2018 news</h2>
<p>The updates, releases, and announcements listed above form only a portion of the vast list of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/aws/aws-previews-and-pre-announcements-at-reinvent-2018-andy-jassy-keynote/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tech introduced during AWS re:Invent 2018</a>. The full list includes updates to Amazon Glacier, AWS RDS, a managed blockchain from AWS and a Quantum Ledger tool for building decentralized apps on AWS infrastructure, and much, much more.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4893" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_AWS_re_Invent_2018_launches.jpg" alt="IT Svit review: AWS re:Invent 2018 - launches" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>We can draw the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite several interesting updates, <b>AWS IaaS offers are mature</b> and we <b>must not expect tectonic shifts</b> in this domain</li>
<li>The company changes the emphasis from providing services to providing AI-augmented solutions, turning internal modules and tools public</li>
<li><b>AWS devotes great effort to building ML-powered ecosystem</b> of services to drive more value to their customers, cost-efficiently and with ease.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are sure the upcoming DevOps events and conferences of 2019 will show new brilliant product launches from AWS, further increasing the range of possibilities for their customers. AWS helps businesses build data-driven, ML-powered solutions to better manage their infrastructure and engage their audiences. Isn’t it what every business wants?</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-reinvent-2018-brief-review/">AWS re: Invent 2018 — a brief review</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>AWS Summit 2018 London was a magnificent event, gathering more than 12,000 attendees and packed to the brim with keynote speeches, workshops and various training sessions, presentations of new technology and announcements of the ongoing development of new features for existing AWS products and services. We provide a brief description and key takeaways from the event below.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-summit-2018-london-highlights-takeaways/">AWS Summit 2018 London: highlights and takeaways</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gathering about 12,000 attendees and more than 4,000 live streamers, AWS Summit London was a tremendous event, highlighting all the new stuff AWS is ready to offer to the business.</p>
<p><span id="more-3144"></span></p>
<p>AWS is undoubtedly the leader of the IaaS market and is constantly innovating to deliver new features to the table and further enable the companies around the globe to reach their business goals. Thus said, the company boasts ever-growing income, and Gavin Jackson, the UK Marketing Director of AWS has disclosed unbelievable numbers: <b>$22bn revenues</b> and <b>49% YoY growth rate</b>, which makes AWS the most dynamic and fast-growing IT company, ever. Gavin has also announced the long-awaited <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/enterprisecontract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">general availability of AWS Marketplace Enterprise Contracts</a>, the feature that will align all the software vendors working with AWS to uniformed contract terms, greatly simplifying the legal processes linked to leveraging the AWS services.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3145" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AWS-Summit-2018-London.jpg" alt="AWS Summit 2018 London - highlights and takeaways" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
The keynote from the Amazon CTO DR. Werner Vogels was built around the fact that AWS becomes Big Data and AI-centered company. AWS provides the businesses of any size with a level playing field, as the cloud service provider makes its services affordable both to startups and multinational enterprises alike. More than <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/10-reasons-give-cloud-computing-go/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">52% of enterprise businesses have already completed their digital transformation</a> and use AWS services to run their products and databases.</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 10px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;"><p><em><b>“We matured our IaaS services way back in 2009/2010.” © Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Thus said, the businesses that run the same infrastructure should seek the competitive edge somewhere else, so Big Data &amp; AI becomes the next field of battle for the performance optimization, better customer outcomes, more personalized offers and bigger revenues. Dr. Vogels backed his story with an interesting use case on how Jaguar Land Rover uses the latest technology to power their connected cars project.</p>
<p>Werner moved on to placing the emphasis of the new cloud efficiency on Machine Learning and AI algorithms, predictive analytics and self-managing infrastructure. He told that he discussed the matter with Microsoft UK CTO Michael Wignall a couple of weeks previously and found out Azure has a 5,000 people strong R&amp;D department devoted solely to evolving the AI &amp; ML services from Azure.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3146" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AWS-Summit-2018-London-1.jpg" alt="AWS Summit 2018 London - highlights and takeaways 1" width="1200" height="415" /></p>
<p>Below is the list of the main updates and new services presented at AWS Summit 2018 London.</p>
<h2>Amazon Aurora improvements</h2>
<p>As Aurora is officially considered the fastest-growing child in the AWS family, it got the most love from Werner:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-backtrack-turn-back-time/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Aurora Backtrack</a>. Just imagine going back in time to any database record with ease, or rewinding the whole Aurora cluster in a blink of an eye. Add the ability to invoke from the console or from API and you will see why this addition was met so warmly.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mAS5buLRQ1s" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" align="middle" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Aurora Serverless</a>. This on-demand service with auto-scaling capabilities completely removes the need to manage the instances. The micro-billing scheme makes this service quite affordable and reliable.</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-aurora-multimaster-preview.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Aurora Multi-Master</a> is the preview of the first relational database that can scale between data centers and write the data to a plethora of DB nodes in a variety of AWS regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Vogels has also reminded that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS Glue</a> is now available in the Europe London AWS region.</p>
<h2>EKS updates</h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fargate for EKS</a> is coming to make EKS on par with Azure ECS and enable production-grade Kubernetes support. As of now, it is in the preview, yet such a container management platform is a treat for enterprise admins worldwide and is long awaited for. Unfortunately, it did not get much love from the audience… well, the ones who were present in the Auditorium are armed and prepared for the future.</p>
<h2>S3 / Glacier Select</h2>
<p>This new capability allows to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/amazon-s3-select-is-now-generally-available/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pull data using SQL expressions</a> and will undoubtedly come in handy for data architects and analysts worldwide.</p>
<h2>The closing thought of AWS Summit 2018 London: Security is EVERYONE’S concern!</h2>
<p>As GDPR came into effect this May and many of European companies are still falling behind on the data security practices implementation, Amazon CTO gave a minute explanation on the AWS security practices and the ways the developers can implement them in their apps to enable the shift to the left. Why not make the apps secure from the beginning, instead of leaving this as a headache-to-deal-with-before-the-release for the security team? The keynote was followed by a variety of great sessions, highlighting various use cases of AWS infrastructure.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3147" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AWS-Summit-2018-London-2.jpg" alt="AWS Summit 2018 London - highlights and takeaways 2" width="1200" height="396" /></p>
<p>The best point of the event was the absence of various “experts” and executives with well-oiled tongues and without any technical background.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expansion continues &#8211; another conference was dedicated to WordPress: the speakers told about CI, the importance of seamless delivery and how to develop your plugin in a cost effective and smart way.</p>
<p><span id="more-1216"></span></p>
<p>Kharkiv WordPress Meetup #3 became the second event related to WordPress after that we talked earlier in the&nbsp;<a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/conferences-and-meetups/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Conferences and MeetUps</a> article. There were two big reports covering the most important aspects &#8211; continuous integration and best practices when developing plugins.</p>
<p>The first speaker told about different challenges that developers face when working with WordPress and discussed the most popular solutions aimed at solving these challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>CI/CD automation based on&nbsp;Jenkins, TeamCity, Codeship, Travis, Wercker</li>
<li>Containerization + Virtualization: Docker + Vagrant</li>
<li>Build a perfect development and testing environment</li>
</ul>
<p>The speaker also showed the development workflow coupled with CI approach that his team uses on a daily basis to streamline WordPress delivery&nbsp;and described which tools are used on which step.</p>
<p>The second speaker when talking about creating commercial plugins (as a case) was way too specific and consistent because there were many aspects to cover and discuss. The report was divided into 4 big logical parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>searching for perfect selling ideas</li>
<li>going through development stages</li>
<li>choosing the right selling platform and making the first sale</li>
<li>supporting, promoting and&nbsp;further development</li>
</ul>
<p>The report was full of interesting thoughts, practical advices on how to follow the best practices according to the pre-defined strategy, as well as avoid common mistakes when making first commercial steps. However, the best thing about the report was that the advices can be applied to non-commercial development as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another weekend and another cool conference &#8211; our team took part in KharkivJS #7.</p>
<p><span id="more-1196"></span></p>
<p>KharkivJS was one of the biggest Ukrainian JS conferences and has become the fourth in which IT Svit team took part.&nbsp;This event lasted 2 days and gathered not only JavaScript developers from all over Ukraine but also 22 speakers from&nbsp;Finland, Great Britain, Netherlands, Russia and Estonia. The conference had two streams &#8211; English and Russian, so that was a unique international experience exchange about&nbsp;various JS benefits and challenges.</p>
<p>The main topics were devoted to React, Angular, IoT and best practices in writing shells and building desktop/web applications.&nbsp;Some of speakers told about their own challenges and solutions they found &#8211; iframe integration and async programming. Our team noted that some of speeches were too specific and a bit boring due to questions related to debugging a faulty code rather than addressing real challenges.&nbsp;However, they also noted the report about React Native as a convenient way to develop applications and make sure they look exactly the same on all devices.</p>
<p>Another thing that our team noted is that there were so many participants that some of them didn&#8217;t receive conference presents and gifts <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It was strange because this aspect had to be taken into consideration when planning the conference activities. BUT! We also took part in mini JS-tasks&nbsp;and then the profiles of those who successfully solved these tasks participated in lottery. And that&#8217;s where we caught lucky by the tail &#8211; our developer won a&nbsp;gyroboard! So, apart from excellent&nbsp;mood, valuable knowledge and improved&nbsp;software architecture practices, our team received something more&#8230; I think we can call it &#8220;a hunting trophy&#8221; :-D.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our team&nbsp;recently had excellent opportunities to attend two local events related to Quality Assurance and Web Development. Both of them were useful and helped our team members deal with specific challenges they had in ongoing projects.</p>
<p><span id="more-1159"></span></p>
<h5>It&#8217;s all about conversation</h5>
<p>Conferences are a perfect way to extend your self-learning expertise &#8211; they provide you with a plenty of useful information to catch from the main conversation/presentation and jibber-jabber talks. Conference speakers sometimes focus on specific aspects of a topic to describe some issues you may come across and how to address them, which means that if you&#8217;re experiencing some troubles while getting things done, you might experience a few &#8220;That&#8217;s what I was looking for&#8221; moments.&nbsp;No matter which approach works better for you, conference makes it easier to connect with new friends and&nbsp;endorse your expertise.</p>
<p>Small conferences are good, but big conferences are even better &#8211; the more people in the same room, the more interesting and vibrant conversations they produce regarding topics being discussed, especially when it comes to those that hold different meaning and opinions. Another situation, when you overcame some specific issues and want to share this knowledge with&nbsp;other listeners &nbsp;is also possible and highly appreciated. The same applies to topics that haven&#8217;t been raised yet or described just for introduction &#8211; you are free to dive deeper into the specifics.</p>
<h5>IT Svit at conferences</h5>
<p>For the last couple of months our team participated in three conferences and meetups of different sizes:&nbsp;Kyiv.py #18, Eatdog&nbsp;#5 and&nbsp;Myths About WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/it-svit-at-the-kyiv-py-18-conference/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kyiv.py was already mentioned in our blog</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;it was a real helper for our Python developers in dealing with current challenges and pitfalls and making code more efficient.</p>
<p><b>Eatdog</b> was focused on QA approaches and tools: BDD, Codeception, creating relevant scenarios and tests, etc. Our guys had an opportunity to talk to the Codeception founder &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/DavertMik" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Michael Bodnarchuk</a>&nbsp;about topics&nbsp;that require special attention. One of them was related to specific Codeception integration with Testrail that hasn&#8217;t been implemented yet. As Michael said, if no suitable alternatives available, this functionality can be added in further releases. Great news!<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1175 size-full" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/4luoCrm7cfg.jpg" alt="4luocrm7cfg" width="1280" height="796"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1176 size-full" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ZolbdQ2MY24.jpg" alt="zolbdq2my24" width="1280" height="854"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1177 size-full" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/C_mDxD1JbSU.jpg" alt="c_mdxd1jbsu" width="1280" height="854"></p>
<p>Other topics that were covered during the conference: BDD approach (Behavior-driven development), how to create tests using BDD and their specific aspects, how to create scenarios and tests using Codeception, etc.</p>
<p><b>Myths About WordPress</b> was focused on describing a bunch of popular&nbsp;prejudices and misconceptions we know about WordPress and how to deal with them. The second part of the conference was related to development: code quality, common security mistakes, API functionality and authentication, best practices in WordPress development, etc. Our developers found some aspects that can be applied to both projects they are working on and also upcoming ones.</p>
<hr>
<p>And also don&#8217;t forget the very first&nbsp;<a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/karazin-winter-school-on-data-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Karazin Winter School&nbsp;conference</a> where our company had been talking about Data Science and Data Analysis, Internet classification, different technologies and tools that can be used to&nbsp;store large amounts of information.</p>
<hr>
<p>All these&nbsp;conferences showed that the idea of picking out a particular problem or a set of associated issues and focusing on finding the simplest, yet efficient solution is splendid. In such a way it is possible to get a&nbsp;chance to connect on a personal level with like-minded people or even find collaborators for project you are afraid of managing alone. As our teams accumulate a wide range of new skills and innovative approaches almost every day, thus accelerating company&#8217;s growth, so different conferences would become even more topical over time.</p>
