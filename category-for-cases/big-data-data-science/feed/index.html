<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>The customer has a pretty large backend Big Data system running on AWS infrastructure. They needed IT Svit to help with the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Planning and performing the upgrade for their Druid instance</li>
<li>Implementing enhanced system monitoring and alerting with Amazon Cloudwatch, Prometheus &amp; Grafana and AlertManager</li>
<li>Configuring a staging environment. They needed access to expertise with Kubernetes, Ansible, Docker, Apache Kafka, Hadoop and Druid, Postgres, Node, AlertManager and Prometheus &amp; Grafana.</li>
<li>Plan and build a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to improve the insights processing pipeline</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>IT Svit was able to accomplish all the tasks in the order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>We moved all the apps from Marathon to Amazon EKS and optimized the system architecture. As a result, Druid cluster upgrade time was reduced 4 times, from 1h to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>We found and resolved the issue that caused application workers to restart frequently on legacy clusters.</li>
<li>We configured the CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate daily cluster operations.</li>
<li>We connected Spinnaker to Prometheus using AlertManager. System abnormal behavior is immediately alerted to Slack and is being resolved much quicker now.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7872" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Results.gif" alt="" width="1900" height="645" /></p>
<h2>Challenges and solutions</h2>
<p>This analytics company has experienced several challenges that hindered product growth and reduced the stability of operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marathon infrastructure was not able to deal with the ever-growing number of requests</li>
<li>Some Big Data input sources were slow and slowed down the whole platform, and the Druid version was very outdated</li>
<li>There was little to no insight on the system performance due to the complexity of the backend structure</li>
</ol>
<p>We solved these issues successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up Airflow for Data Analysis automation.</li>
<li>Updated Druid and Spinnaker to the latest versions</li>
<li>Set up the ECS cluster and moved the majority of our apps from Marathon to Amazon EKS.</li>
<li>Installed and configured Jenkins pipelines for automated application updates.</li>
<li>Set up monitoring and notifications using Prometheus, Grafana and AlertManager.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>By updating Druid and Spinnaker, moving from Marathon to EKS, resolving the issues with Jenkins and implementing in-depth monitoring with smart alerting IT Svit helped the customer to ensure the systems operate at top efficiency, are updated seamlessly and any incidents are instantly reported and quickly resolved.</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/business-insights-data-analytics-platform/">Business Insights & Data Analytics Platform</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The solution consists of the <b>CCTV cameras installed at the key roads of the city</b>, paired with <b>Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, and 3 or 4G modems</b>. The cameras take photos of each passing car, the IoT node identifies the brand and the model and this information is sent to the cloud processing server. This way, a huge dataset of actually used car brands and models is formed real-time, which can be leveraged to deliver the predictive analysis for the market, like producing certain amounts of spare parts, opening new service centers and certifying the technicians for them.</p>
<p><span id="more-6011"></span></p>
<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>In order for the system to work we had to ensure the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>IoT side had to be able to <b>take the photos</b> of the cars, <b>identify the car model</b> using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), <b>send the report</b> to the cloud server and <b>delete the photo afterward</b> to comply with <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/gdpr-can-ruin-trampoline-business/">GDPR</a>.</li>
<li>Back-end side had to be able to accept the reports, filter and aggregate them and store the data in a  NoSQL database</li>
<li>Front-end side had to be able to represent the charts and reports and provide the end user APIs to interact with any third-party analytical system</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project results</h2>
<p>The solution works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>CCTV cameras are installed at the key roads of the city, paired with Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, and 3 or 4G modems</li>
<li>The cameras take photos of each passing car, the IoT node identifies the brand and the model, and this information is sent to the cloud-based processing server</li>
<li><b>A huge dataset</b> of actually used car brands and models <b>is formed real-time</b></li>
<li>This data can be leveraged to deliver the predictive analysis for the market, like producing certain amounts of spare parts, opening new service centers and certifying the technicians for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The system we developed has shown good results during the alpha-testing phase. One IoT node is able to identify about <b>150 cars per minute</b> (rush hour on a three-lane road), which makes the system quite feasible from the analytical perspective.</p>

<ul>
<li>The quantity of livestock,</li>
<li>The numbers of animals gotten ill,</li>
<li>Symptoms of the disease</li>
<li>Types of medication administered</li>
<li>How many animals recuperated or perished after treatment</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>The customer wanted us to provide the following services:</p>

<p><span id="more-6005"></span></p>
<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>The customer wanted each customer to be able to form a unique, personalized news feed, based on their preferences and search filters. IT Svit had to provide the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The news data must be relevant</b>, meaning the data set must be frequently updated</li>
<li><b>The news must be categorized</b> to simplify the navigation and personalize the user experience</li>
<li>To be valuable, <b>only the primary source of the news</b> must be listed, not the duplicates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project results</h2>
<p>IT Svit has built a powerful, flexible and highly performant news aggregation platform. Our subscribers could embed our news feed code into their websites and have the latest niche news related to their industry shown on respective websites.</p>

<div class="product-overview__info">
<h3>Client’s Goals</h3>
<p>The customer needed a platform for automated collection, verification, deduplication and classification of industry-specific news from a variety of credible sources. These news feeds would be both shown on a web portal, and/or could be embedded into any website.</p>
<p>The system should have had the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data set must be frequently updated and kept relevant</li>
<li>The news must be categorized to simplify the navigation and personalize the user experience</li>
<li>Only the primary source of the news must be listed, not the duplicates</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<div class="product-overview__info">
<h3>Implementation and challenges resolved</h3>
<p>IT Svit team started by building a highly-performant web scraper tool using aiohttp library. The data gathered was stored to MongoDB. We created several Machine Learning models using Theano and selected the one that provided optimal performance. We used these Machine Learning algorithms to filter out the irrelevant and/or unwanted content.</p>
<p>The platform front-end was built using jQuery, the back-end instances were containerized and automatically scaled using Docker. We used SphinxSearch to allow the customers to create their personalized news feeds.</p>
<p>As the product was intended to be used as a plugin on any website, we had to make it both simplistic and highly configurable.</p>
<ul>
<li>We created a huge base of news sources worldwide, split by industries, locations, spheres of interest</li>
<li>This base was frequently and rapidly updated, using a highly performant tool that swiftly analyzed the article content to check if it was updated</li>
<li>The platform was able to create a personalized news feed for any customer, based on their preferences and settings</li>
<li>The aggregator could be easily embedded into any website as a plugin with simple configuration</li>
