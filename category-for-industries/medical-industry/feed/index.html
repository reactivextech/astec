										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The market of medical cloud computing grows quickly, and many US healthcare organizations start using the cloud for medical records storage. IT Svit provides experienced dedicated DevOps and software engineers that deliver top-notch cloud-based medical services!</p>
<p><span id="more-7249"></span></p>
<p>Equifax data leak of 2017 showed everyone that on-prem data centers maintained by low-skilled administrators that did not apply OS security patches for years are not quite safe as storage for medical records and personal details. Nowadays, various medical businesses and healthcare organizations in the US and worldwide transition to the cloud to use its benefits. IT Svit helps enable medical cloud computing systems for a variety of purposes, from enabling cloud backup for medical applications to providing secure cloud backup for medical files.</p>
<h2>Management of cloud-based medical services</h2>
<p>There are multiple cloud-based medical services today, from telemedicine to smartwatches that alert 911 if their wearer has a heart attack while jogging in the park. New applications appear daily and the market of medical cloud services grown by tens of percent annually. We can help you enter this lucrative niche and succeed, by providing reliable software delivery practices, automated infrastructure management and workflow monitoring.</p>
<h2>Configuring safe cloud storage for medical files</h2>
<p>Patient records and other medical files are one of the primary targets for fraudsters and hackers. Secure storage and ensuring authorized access to this data is crucial for ensuring stable operations of medical apps and positive end-user experience. IT Svit helps configure cloud services for medical files secure storage and processing, so your customers can know their data is safeguarded by all the power of cloud security services.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-7251 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ItSvit_Cloud-for-medical_conclusion_2-8.png" alt="" width="752" height="395" /></p>
<h2>We build medical cloud computing solutions for your business</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways medical companies and healthcare organizations can use cloud computing to improve the efficiency and security of their operations. Storing medical records online saves a ton of money in terms of the total cost of ownership due to removing the need to build and maintain in-house data centers with specialized equipment, like water cooling, secondary power sources, fire alarms and humidity control. The costs of maintaining these systems in the cloud data centers are spread between thousands of users and are pretty negligible.</p>
<p>Another way of leveraging the cloud is to use cloud applications for medical solutions development and management. The medical industry is a highly competitive business and the company that delivers the most value to the customers usually wins. Implementing feedback quickly and providing the requested features for your products in a month, not in a year is one of the best ways to ensure customer loyalty and brand advocacy. Below we will describe how using cloud computing empowers the development of medical applications.</p>
<p>Another, but not the least important way to use cloud computing for medical services includes cloud backup for medical processes and data processed by on-prem solutions. It’s no secret that Big Data analytics and Machine Learning algorithms can be used in healthcare with great success. The problem there is that huge data sets should be processed quickly and it cannot be done in the cloud, as the data transfer speed limits the data analysis speed.</p>
<p>Doing it on-prem, however, limits the efficiency of the method, as on-prem server clusters are limited in size, so the processed data must be erased to allow storing the new one. Cloud backup for medical files allows moving them to the cloud at the maximum speed the on-prem solution can provide and quickly spinning up the infrastructure powerful enough to process them quickly before the results become irrelevant.</p>
<p>These and other methods of using cloud computing services for medical apps ensure cost-efficiency and resilience of operations, the robustness of features and security of the results. Making it all possible requires an in-depth understanding of how cloud solutions like AWS or GCP actually work, however. The problem is, such knowledge is rare on the market in general and is hard to come by for medical organizations, in particular.</p>
<p>Why so? Because the times have changed and the technology changed too. A decade or so ago the IT systems used in different industries had little in common, so a software engineer that worked in banking had to learn the ropes literally from scratch if accepting a position in the energy industry, for example — because the mainframe systems were totally different. With the introduction of cloud computing, software engineers from any industry gained an ability to use the same tools and procedures to solve their industry-specific challenges.</p>
<p>The problem here is that cloud computing technology is very complex and takes a long time to master on your own, meaning your IT engineers cannot gain this expertise easily. All cloud vendors like AWS, Google Cloud, MS Azure, DigitalOcean or IBM Cloud provide an extensive knowledge base with detailed guides on their features — but reading the guides does not equal to learning all the nooks and crannies of the cloud features, as well as the best practices and ways to configure various cloud computing services for medical businesses.</p>
<p>Why is it so? Because to operate the cloud-based medical services efficiently you need to operate the cloud services all the time for a variety of projects to understand the best practices of cloud system architecture and the best approaches to make them interact with each other. This methodology is called DevOps and the specialists able to deliver DevOps services are very valued, so you will not be able to find one on the job market so easily.</p>
<p>DevOps engineers prefer to work for 2 kinds of companies — Managed Services Providers like IT Svit or cloud service providers like AWS and Google. Working at IT outsourcing companies allows DevOps engineers to master all the cloud services quickly while building projects for companies from different industries. Once they get enough experience, they move on to work for global enterprises or cloud service providers to move the DevOps culture further and build the tools and solutions they work with.</p>
<p>They learn from more experienced colleagues — as DevOps methodology is a culture of collaboration within the team and between the teams, so they share the knowledge instead of hoarding it. They obtain a pool of ready solutions for a variety of typical challenges that regularly emerge during projects, and they have the ability to constantly improve their skills while working with the latest stable versions of the most popular DevOps tools and cloud modules, so they keep abreast with the latest technology.</p>
<p>Thus said, outsourcing the tasks of managing cloud applications for medical companies to Managed Services Providers like IT Svit ensures your company gets instant access to a pool of skilled and motivated software engineers and they get a new interesting project to work on. This is a win-win situation for both parties, as DevOps specialists gain experience and improve their skills, while your company obtains cost-effective, resilient, scalable and secure solutions for cloud medical services. If this sounds like the results you want to achieve — let It Svit know, we would be glad to help you leverage medical cloud computing to the max!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/industries/medical-cloud-computing-services-from-it-svit/">Medical cloud computing services from IT Svit</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>
