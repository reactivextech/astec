<h2>Guide for picking the right Terraform Security Code Analysis Tool</h2>



<p>Have you ever been puzzled by the wide range of choices of static analysis tools for Terraform?&nbsp; Marko Fábry, Cloud Architect and Marek Šottl, Cloud Security Engineer at Revolgy closely looked at the tooling to identify security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations for AWS and GCP. The experts decided to unify different preferences of engineers at Revolgy to provide improved and more consistent secure services to customers. Revolgy engineers started their own testing PoC and evaluated results based on various metrics including false positive and false negative rating, integration options and quality of the recommendations themselves. Revolgy experts in their <a href="https://revolgy.com/blog/complete-guide-for-picking-the-right-tool-for-terraform-security-code-analysis/?utm_source=telegram.me&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=polnyypo-versii-avtora-gayd-po-vyboru">complete guide for picking the right tool for Terraform Security Code Analysis</a> stressed that there are other tools besides Kubernetes and Ansible aimed at security scanning that are more plug-and-play. At the end of the article, they compare a specific set of such tools.</p>



<h2>Curated Collection of SRE Resources and Examples from first-rate IT organizations</h2>



<p>Need examples of how IT organizations practice SRE (site reliability engineering) around the world? Here is a <a href="https://github.com/upgundecha/howtheysre?utm_source=telegram.me&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=horoshiy-kuriruemyy-repozitoriy-s-ssylkam">curated collection of publicly available resources on how technology and tech-savvy organizations around the world practice SRE</a>. In 2003 Google had given a task to their software engineers to make their grand scale site more efficient, reliable and user-friendly. The approach Google team used to work with the site turned out to be so effective that many IT giants decided to adopt it. We talk about site reliability engineering practices that are used to implement software development solutions into IT operations processes like performance planning, configuring, monitoring, failure alerting and others. These practices correlate perfectly with DevOps such as continuous integration/delivery and infrastructure as a code approach. Due to SRE, tasks traditionally performed by operation specialists, manually, as a rule, are resolved using automation and software. Automation is the most essential component of the SRE model as site reliability engineers are always searching for ideas on how to improve and automate operations tasks. This way, SRE enhances system’s reliability. In the curated repository of best SRE practices, Github experts collected the most reliable and efficient tools, techniques, books lists from leading IT organizations. However, note please, that repository was created recently, the <a href="https://github.com/upgundecha/howtheysre?utm_source=telegram.me&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=horoshiy-kuriruemyy-repozitoriy-s-ssylkam">list </a>itself might refer to some of the articles, posts, videos, tools, and techniques published a couple of years ago.</p>



<h2>Kubernetes API Priority and Fairness regulation&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Ivan Slim in his <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/https://itnext.io/kubernetes-api-priority-and-fairness-b1ef2b8a26a2">article about the Kubernetes API Priority and Fairness </a>(<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/">APF</a>) shared what he has discovered and showed how to define policies to prioritize and throttle inbound requests to the Kubernetes API server. Additionally, Ivan went over some metrics and debugging endpoints that can be used to determine if APF is affecting controllers. As a result, he showed how to create custom <em>FlowShema</em> and <em>PirorutyLevelConfiguration </em>resources to regulate inbound traffic to API servers and went over the specifications of these resources.</p>



<h2>Kubernetes NetworkPolicy Editor&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you want to adopt <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/">Kubernetes NetworkPolicies </a>for apps in your cluster, you should be ready that the learning curve from very basic examples to more complex real-world policies is steep. Even experienced Kubernetes YAML-experts can still easily make their brain explode working through an advanced network policy use case. In the<a href="https://www.cncf.io/webinars/this-week-in-cloud-native-demystifying-kubernetes-network-policy/"> Livestream from Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>, Thomas Graf went over everything from the basics of Kubernetes Network Policy to more advanced concepts. He explained step by step from setting up simple policies to tackling trickier questions such as spotting and avoiding conflicting rules, looking at common mistakes, and examining some advanced real-world policy examples similar to those implemented by major Kubernetes users. What’s more, CNI Cilium experts created the <a href="https://editor.cilium.io">NetworkPolicy Editor </a>project, which allows you to create, visualize and share network policies online.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>IAM Access Analyzer Policy Validation Update</h2>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, AWS announced the release of the policy validation<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/aws/iam-access-analyzer-update-policy-validation/"> add-on for the IAM Access Analyzer</a> &#8212; a tool allowing to validate IAM policy configurations for security compliance (over 100 tests based on AWS IAM best practices) and detailed recommendations for configuring IAM. You can use it directly from the IAM Console web interface when creating IAM policies, and the same CLI/API AWS access analyzer validate-policy for integration with custom CI/CD workflows, without the need for third-party tools. From a security point of view, this is a very useful and on-demand functionality that is designed to at least partially solve the problem of misconfigs when configuring IAM policies.</p>



<h2>DevOps roadmap&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Dreaming about a DevOps engineer’s role in a high-class company? DevOps experts of the DevOps Journey community prepared a quite helpful video informing entry-level DevOps specialists or developers/sysadmins wishing to switch to DevOps of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pxbp6FyTfk">DevOps roadmap</a> relevant in 2021. <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/devops-resume-2021-and-interview-questions-get-ready/">DevOps engineers</a> are supposed to work with developing and IT operations teams, QA specialists and production teams to supervise the code delivery and release. DevOps engineers are supposed to have and utilize well-developed soft and hard skills to break the time-honored wall between software production teams and impeccably manage IT infrastructure. Moreover, DevOps engineers should be endowed with leadership and business skills to work with the teams. If you desire to become one, you have to accept the fact that your way to success will not be a piece of cake, just remember IT Svit is here to help you at any stage of your path.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more than 10 years DevOps implementation has been an extremely desired goal for many IT businesses. And, with pandemic 2020 raising its ugly head, all the time limits for DevOps adoption, in general, and CI/CD application, in concrete terms, have noticeably shrunk. According to CircleCI CEO Jim Rose, COVID-19 has considerably squeezed the time that organizations needed to reach CI/CD. IT businesses rapidly caught that archaic on-premises Jenkins running is not an option anymore, especially in today’s hybrid or even remote-only flows. However, even before the pandemic struck the world, companies were turning to CI/CD automation. A need for CI/CD automation appeared when developers got tired of endless and exhausting manual testing and committing their code to the core repository every time any change took place. This can happen a couple of times a day, sometimes much more. As a result, developers wasted hours, days and even weeks on laborious, repetitive, hand-operated testing and deploying, which is not influencing their productivity positively. How automated CI/CD pipelines can help IT organizations save money and developers’ wasted on toil time, will be covered here. </p>



<h2>How CI/CD automation helps save time compared to manual deploying</h2>



<p>Today developers can make dozens/hundreds and in some cases thousands of changes to their main software daily, so it’s even hard to imagine how much time the process of tasting and delivering those changes would take, if done manually. Taking plenty of toil out of SDLC is the key point of DevOps, which is all about delivering high-quality software and features as fast as possible and gaining swift feedback from customers. DevOps promotes CI/CD automation, as with CI/CD properly set-up and programmed, product delivery speed evolves notably. In fact, Puppet experts in their recent <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/?refinementList%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Report&amp;page=1&amp;configure%5BhitsPerPage%5D=18">report</a> identified that organizations utilizing CI/CD practices deploy 46x more frequently and spend up to 44% more time on creative work.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8070" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<h2>How CI/CD automation helps save money compared to manual deploying&nbsp;</h2>



<p>From IT experts’ point of view the significance of DevOps methodology, in general, and CI/CD automation, in particular, is quite clear. However, for some leaders, it might be hard to follow how the whole investment in CI/CD tools (pretty often very sizable) can be beneficial in the end. If this is your case, let’s discuss how CI/CD automation can lower costs for your organization. Fast/frequently released software and features save not only time but also cut down on:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><b>Deeply expensive downtime.</b> Long-term downtime does not only influence your revenue negatively but also undermines your company’s credibility.</li><li><b>Troubleshooting costs</b>. With CI/CD pipeline properly automated, the process of the product deployment and release is more reliable and developers are not wasting hours on bug-fixing.</li><li><b>Switching/onboarding costs</b>. Automated CI/CD let new members of the team get down to business right away without having to deal with an exhausting learning curve.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Staff turnover costs</b>. Happy employees &#8212; more successful company! When developers are freed from manual, repetitive tasks, they focus on creating new features and code and continuous quality improvement, isn&#8217;t that right? Sure, it is. With them knowing they can rely on their system, employees become more relaxed and satisfied and, as a result, they stay with you, work harder and become more and more in love with the company.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>How to implement CI/CD automation</h2>



<p>With CI/CD pipelines you can have constant integration, software in a releasable condition upkeeping, continuous testing/monitoring and fast reaction to issues. For those who are already thinking of switching from manual to fully automated deploying we can give the following recommendations:</p>



<ul><li>Make tests for the significant bits of the codebase.</li><li>Use a CI tool to run the tests when clusters of code are incorporated into the branch.&nbsp;</li><li>Settle any issues just as you spot them.&nbsp;</li><li>Make a separate test for each story.</li><li>Use automated CD tools to initiate the code in the new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Utilize CD pipelines for monitoring and alarms to have full supervision over the flow.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="2375" height="1240" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying-.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8068" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying-.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying--768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying--1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money-compared-to-manual-deploying--2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></figure>



<h2>Why is CI/CD better with DevOps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With CI/CD introduction, the process of code building, testing, committing the altered versions back to the core repository and rapid deployment to the user’s environment anytime when needed is fully automated, which spares developers much of their time and nerves. Gitlab experts in their<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/"> 2020 DevSecOps survey</a> claimed that more than 80% of developers started releasing their code more frequently and more than 50% of companies started releasing a couple of times a day, compared to recent once a week/month realization. On the other hand, improperly implied, CI/CD pipelines will not only be inefficient but also significantly delay the software delivery process. That’s where DevOps saves the day. You cannot adopt one or a couple of CI/CD tools and consider your mission complete. No, it doesn’t work this way. You need DevOps holistic approach to automate CI/CD pipelines properly. In the nutshell, you need to choose the right CI/CD tools, build pipelines which should be simple, fast, free of bottlenecks and secure. And, in addition, they should be run in segregated environments, containers help you, and many more issues to consider.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="1140" height="595" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money_Infographics.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8069" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money_Infographics.jpg 1140w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/How-CICD-automation-helps-save-money_Infographics-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></figure>



<p>To set up and automate CI/CD pipelines correctly is not a piece of cake, especially for small businesses and startups that experience a lack of skilled specialists. If this is your case you should turn to DevOps companies that provide<a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/"> DevOps services</a>. Their teams will establish and automate simple, fast and secure CI/CD pipelines for your team to become more productive, and for your business to grow. As an example we, at IT Svit, worked on improving a Druid instance<a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/business-insights-data-analytics-platform/"> for Big Data analytics platform</a> on AWS and one of the project requirements we set planning and building CI/CD pipeline utilizing Jenkins. Before CI/CD automation it took one hour for the cluster to update. But after our DevOps experts configured and automated CI/CD pipeline the upgrade takes only 15 minutes. </p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>To finish the story, we’d like to stress that if you want to rapidly release high-performing and client-focused software with notable teams’ productivity improvement, you should automate your SDLC at most.  CI/CD automation is a smart solution for developers who don’t want to waste their time and energy on completing repetitive assignments but desire to concentrate on new products/features creation. What’s more, CI/CD pipelines, when properly automated,  allow teams to swiftly react to bugs/errors and immediately fix them that significantly increases customers’ satisfaction. On the other hand, CI/CD set-up and automated incorrectly might not only be inefficient but also cause delays and unreasonable spending. <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/ci-cd-services/" title="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/ci-cd-services/">CI/CD automation </a>is one of the numerous DevOps practices, and if you are thinking of adopting the DevOps methodology, it’s about time to do so. At the same time, it might be rather overwhelming for companies to grow the in-house DevOps team, particularly for small businesses and startups. In such cases, the best solution is to turn to mature DevOps companies that provide <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/">DevOps services </a>to streamline your workflow. DevOps experts will design and implement an automation strategy for you and provide your team with total support and tech documentation. </p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/how-ci-cd-automation-saves-money-and-time/">How CI/CD Automation Saves Money and Time</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><span id="more-5116"></span></p>
<p>The process of software delivery can be quite easily obstructed or even halted by release downtimes, testing loops, faulty implementations and so on. In order to minimize the risks and secure a healthy bottom line, the business must make sure their product or service runs well, performs good at scale, is updated frequently and does not crash while</p>
<p>deployed to production. Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration pipelines are essential for ensuring this.</p>
<h2>What is Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)</h2>
<p>Before proceeding, we have to define the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/devops-glossary-78-basic-devops-terms-in-simple-words/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DevOps terms</a> of <b>Continuous Integration</b> and <b>Continuous Delivery</b> as we use them, to remove any possible misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Continuous Integration — the software delivery practice, when each team member contributes their code to the master branch on a regular basis, to keep the codebase updated at all times.</p>
<p>Due to this approach, the risk of source code inconsistency is minimal, and every developer can synchronize their daily code commits with the team easily. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Continuous Integration</a> should be coupled with automated unit testing so that as soon as the code is committed to the mainline, it is tested, pushed to the build server and prepared to be deployed to production immediately.</p>
<p>Continuous Delivery — the software delivery practice, where each update can be shipped to the end users automatically, as soon as the code is built and tested to avoid downtime on release.</p>
<p>What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Continuous Delivery</a> in real life? It is the process of configuring the Terraform and Kubernetes manifests, Ansible playbooks, Jenkins jobs and other kinds of DevOps tooling to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform automatic virtual infrastructure provisioning,</li>
<li>Provide a testing server configuration,</li>
<li>Ensure unit tests execution,</li>
<li>Send notifications of successful testing completion (or failures),</li>
<li>Enable packaging of ready source code to push it into production</li>
<li>Removing downtime due to in-app updates or rolling updates</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, while CI/CD is quite a worthy approach, it becomes hard to implement at scale. For example, in an enterprise environment, there can be dozens of product development teams with hundreds of code commits daily. All this source code must be built and tested on testing and staging servers, before being pushed to production. The developers should be informed if the tests failed or succeeded and should be given the context of the failure to minimize the bug-fixing time.</p>
<p>This all assumes the software development process is straightforward and plain. In reality, things usually differ. A lot. The&nbsp;case of a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18442941" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">former Oracle Database developer described on Ycombinator</a> illustrates this well. He had to work on a product well over a decade in development, containing 25 million (!!!) lines of code. Every change, in this case, becomes a step over the bog of interlocking tests, dependencies, and requirements. A minor bug fix can take up to 2 months, with a single new feature implementation taking up to a year. He quit the job with Oracle due to that.</p>
<h2>The grim reality of outdated software delivery processes</h2>
<p>The common choice for building software delivery pipelines is with the help of a myriad of scripts. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such scripts are usually not too informative. If the automated unit tests fail, it is impossible to understand if the failure happened due to an error in the test or due to the incorrect script execution. The incident reports are usually fragmentary and do not provide an exhaustive picture of the issue root causes. There is usually no possibility to know if the series of tests are completed successfully, or if the 3rd out of 20 failed.</p>
<p>The email or messenger notifications on test success or failure (if any exist) cannot be easily configured to involve only the developers responsible for the new code changes. As the product grows in size and complexity, this turns into an incessant stream of notifications that can flood the recipients completely. In addition, keeping a huge base of scripts up-to-date is a tedious and tiresome task, which draws the resources away from the main effort of delivering more value to the users.</p>
<p>Thus said, many businesses and organizations of all sizes worldwide begin to implement the CI/CD principles, practices, and tools to be able to ship code to end users several times a day, not once half a year.</p>
<h2>Main principles of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery</h2>
<p>Out of pure logic and common sense, we can outline several main principles of continuous deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Standardized testing pipelines</b> — there is only one way to test and deploy the code</li>
<li><b>Instant code testing</b> — the new code batches should be tested at once after they are committed</li>
<li><b>Instant artifacts building</b> — new product versions should be built as soon as the new code is successfully tested to be ready for being deployed to the production environment</li>
<li><b>Environment-agnostic delivery</b> — the code should be packaged in a way to ensure maximum portability</li>
<li><b>Feedback consistency</b> — the outcomes of the CI process should be consistent and uniform across any language runtime</li>
<li><b>Short feedback loops</b> — the developers should be able to draw actionable insights from the feedback to apply the fixes as soon as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, that there is not yet any question of tooling or level of expertise — these are the plainly visible and straightforward requirements that can benefit any team and any project. The benefits of this approach to CI/CD are quite tangible:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rapid delivery of new products and features</b></li>
<li><b>Ease of customer and team onboarding</b></li>
<li><b>Ease of recovery in case of force-majeure</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the main goal of CI/CD approach is to remove any friction and unnecessary waste between the commit and deploy of new code. The main issue here is that the developers are often unaware of where their code currently is in the pipeline, as described above.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5120" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Shortening-the-feedback-loop-with-CI-CD_feedback.jpg" alt="Main principles of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery" width="1338" height="700"></p>
<h2>Transparency: the main benefit of CI/CD</h2>
<p>To rectify this situation and implement the CI/CD pipelines the team must answer several important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When should the feedback be provided?</li>
<li>How much context does it have to include?</li>
<li>How often should the feedback be given?</li>
</ul>
<p>We have mentioned the flaws of incorrect implementation of these processes already:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Too many notifications</em> might flood your team with irrelevant messages</li>
<li><em>Simple constatations of errors are useless</em> if they do not hold any explanatory context</li>
<li>The messages that are<em> sent after the series</em> of automated tests is completed are<em> useless, if the very first test fails</em></li>
<li>The message <em>sent to the wrong contributor</em> is equally useless as the one not sent at all (or even more damaging, as it wastes the time of a professional)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, the CI/CD pipelines should be implemented using the version control system (VCS) like GitHub and open source <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/must-have-devops-tools-make-things-right-get-go/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DevOps tools</a> like Jenkins, CircleCI or GitlabCI, which allow solving the aforementioned issues. These platforms can be configured to provide exempts of error logs on failure or confirm success on passing the tests. They can get the code contributor tags for each batch separately and inform only the relevant developers. They can be configured to issue warnings as soon as the test fails, not after the whole series is completed to avoid fruitless waiting.</p>
<p>Thus said, the feedback on the code delivery is transparent due to simple, yet effective rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Send only one notification on the failure</b> of a series of tests. The developer that investigates it will discover the rest of the failures in the log and will not be frustrated with spam of multiple identical messages</li>
<li>Likewise, <b>inform on successful testing merely once</b></li>
<li>In the case of test failure, <b>provide enough context to clarify the issue</b>, but not too much to overwhelm the developer with unneeded details</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, if the developer receives a Slack notification that his/her code did not pass the test, we expect the message to include the link to the code Github branch in question, the name of the repository, the number of the pull request and the identifier of the unit test that failed. Such an approach to composing the error reports speeds up the code delivery many times over, as the developers do not have to guess and locate the issue roots.</p>

<p>The same principles can be applied to system monitoring, logging and data analysis, operating the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/create-self-healing-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">self-healing IT infrastructure</a> and other ChatOps use cases. Wherever the software engineers are informed of an issue or task through a messenger notification, the message should be concise and to the point, while containing all the links to the essentials. This approach helps to make sure the true CI/CD is in place — transparency of workflows along with short feedback loops.</p>
<h2>Conclusions on shortening the feedback loop with CI/CD tools</h2>
<p>IT Svit team uses various <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/30-open-source-devops-tools-svit-uses/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">open-source DevOps tools</a> in our workflows. Utilizing the capabilities of Jenkins, CircleCI, GitlabCI and other tools, modern DevOps engineers can ensure the fluidity of software delivery, as well as cost-efficiency and lowering the risks of running the infrastructure in production. The essential task here is configuring the given tools to interoperate seamlessly and provide the required feedback data.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Every developer knows how troublesome and laborious updating a huge project is. Adding new features requires intense testing, updating multiple dependencies and managing numerous variables in multiple GitHub repos. One might assume this is the daily nightmare of the giant projects like Angular or Google. Quite the contrary, these teams have found a solution that greatly streamlines and simplifies the code delivery. This solution is monorepo and here is why it’s cool.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/monorepo-google-way-ci-cd/">Monorepo — the Google way to do CI/CD</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing a huge codebase can be a daunting task, due to the need to keep in mind and constantly update multiple variables. Monorepo enables the true CI/CD, and here is how.</p>
<p><span id="more-3533"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Source control done the Google way is simple</a>. Instead of creating separate repositories for new projects, they create new top-level folders in their monorepo. This way they keep all the dependencies, variables and code components in one place. This is the reason behind their multiple daily product updates — every code commit essentially becomes a release once it passes the tests!</p>
<p>Let’s repeat this once more:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Every code commit essentially becomes a release with monorepo!</b></p></blockquote>
<p>The implications are HUGE. Instead of pushing the code to Canary builds for user acceptance and letting it work for some time to fix the bugs, Google performs automated testing on the stage of committing new code batch to the repository. This allows saving an enormous amount of time and computing resources on testing. The best part — all the dependencies are updated automatically. This is… incredible.</p>
<p>Thus said, why not follow the lead and adopt the monorepo? If you implement this right, you are actually doing the truly Continuous Integration of new code (which leads to Continuous Delivery of new product features). Otherwise, you are doing frequent integration at best… The benefits for end users are also tremendous — they always use the latest stable build of your product and don’t have to rebuild or redeploy their environments. Everything just… works.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3537" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/monorepo-downsides.jpg" alt="Monorepo downsides" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
But there should be downsides, surely? Yes, there are a couple, and Google has kindly provided workarounds for these:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, many <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/must-have-devops-tools-make-things-right-get-go/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">popular DevOps tools</a> make <b>unneeded assumptions that the repo is owned by the whole team</b>. This results in a mess of the needed code reviews, bugs reporting, bug fixes and actions to be made after every change. The workaround is <em>providing more granular code control</em>, not only to show who owns the whole repo but to highlight which team member owns which code. The corresponding <a href="https://github.com/blog/2392-introducing-code-owners" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GitHub feature is called &#8220;code owners&#8221;</a> and this helps define the workflow precisely, exactly the way Pull requests should work — collaborators ask the code owner for permission to update the code and check the change in the most convenient way.</li>
<li>Secondly, <b>issue trackers assume the repo equals the project</b>. There is no simple solution, but the <em>Angular team leverages</em> <em>user tags</em> to organize the repo parts corresponding the various project parts. This helps ease and streamline the source control of the monorepo to make it a manageable and filterable codebase.</li>
<li>Lastly, the <b>numbers of notifications are overwhelming</b>. When a team collaborates on a project, each team member gets lots and lots of GitHub notifications, which he should sift through to find the important stuff. When a huge organization works on a monorepo, the stream of notification turns into a flood. By now, the only solution is <em>manually pinging the person responsible</em> for the needed action, and this issue still needs solving.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the downsides of using a monorepo are few and can be relatively easily overcome. They are surpassed by far by the savings in the resource expenses, product testing efficiency and software delivery pipeline simplification.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on using the monorepo to do the real CI/CD</h2>
<p>We hope you will also appreciate the monorepo as much as we do. Of course, Jenkins and other CI/CD tools can work with multiple repos just as well as with a monorepo. However, the difference between frequent deployments and truly continuous integration is huge. When each new code commit seamlessly becomes the new product release, the testing is automated and done prior to building the code, you can totally omit the QA/Canary process and save a ton of resources, time and overhead.</p>
<p>The beginning of 2019 saw an interesting discussion on the <a href="https://medium.com/@mattklein123/monorepos-please-dont-e9a279be011b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">benefits and shortcomings of monorepos and polyrepos</a> between <a href="https://twitter.com/mattklein123" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Matt Klein</a>, the head engineer of Lyft and <a href="https://medium.com/@adamhjk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Adam Jacob</a>, the CTO @ Chef. While Matt made his point that <b>monorepos make code deployment at scale quite troublesome</b> and demand dealing with multiple limitations, Adam replied in the sense that <a href="https://medium.com/@adamhjk/monorepo-please-do-3657e08a4b70" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the main benefit of monorepos is increased visibility and responsibility across multiple teams in enterprize-scale environments</a>. Multiple repositories make teams working at little code branches feel isolated and not responsible for the issues of other teams. Monorepo destroys such a situation from the get-go, as everybody is on the spotlight all the time, and the teams are forced to communicate and collaborate BEFORE major backward compatibility issues arise, not AFTER.</p>
<p>The benefits of using the monorepo for any business involved in software delivery are essential. IT Svit makes the most of this approach to code delivery pipeline management to power our projects, which results in multiple <a href="https://clutch.co/profile/it-svit#reviews" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">5-star reviews</a> of our satisfied customers on Clutch.co.
