										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span id="more-7445"></span>
<!--noteaser-->



<p>DevOps methodology of software development and infrastructure management is now the most popular approach to IT operations, as it allows to greatly reduce OPEX and decrease time-to-value while keeping the quality of products and operations high. This is why most businesses want to gain access to DevOps expertise in some way: hire it internally, as technical support from cloud providers or as managed services from remote DevOps companies. Today we list best DevOps services providers globally as of 2020.</p>



<p>However, how do you determine the company is good — or best, for that matter? Do you judge by the number of accolades received or by the number of projects completed? Or by the team size, or by the number of certifications from various cloud platforms? Not necessarily.</p>



<h2>Qualities of a good DevOps company</h2>



<p>A good technology partner — and the best one for your DevOps needs — should have several qualities that do not depend on the number of specifications, but can be easily checked during a technical call:</p>



<ul><li><b>Empathy</b>. When you receive feedback from your customers, they want to know you can hear them and be in their shoes. The same goes for talking with a DevOps provider when you are a customer — you want to make sure they hear you. During the technical call, they must ask questions and closer to its end they must be able to voice the problem statement themselves.<br><br>Unfortunately, many DevOps companies have been there too many times and each new project is just a sequence of actions for them. They might come up with ready solutions for your project before you even finish describing the requirements (as really, most projects involve very similar stages that every DevOps company has done a hundred times already).<br><br>However, it is very important to work with a team that approaches your product methodically and clears out all aspects of the project instead of discovering some obstacles amidst the implementation of the CI/CD pipeline.</li><li><b>Open-mindedness</b>. DevOps is the practical implementation of Agile methodology, but it does not mean it cannot be used with Waterfall processes. Many companies still do Waterfall operations for some good reasons — but they can benefit from DevOps to no lesser degree. <br><br>Your DevOps consulting partner must assess all your processes and tools in place and be able to suggest several quick wins (like providing a library of scripts for automated deployment and configuration of testing environments), which can reduce the time-to-value for your processes significantly. This might even help overcome the reason, however compelling it might be, for your team to use Waterfall — and help you become more Agile, efficient and productive. But Agile adoption must never be voiced as a prerequisite for DevOps implementation, as it can work without it.</li><li><b>Expertise</b>. 5 years is a good minimal term to master tools like AWS, Google Cloud, Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, etc. — and become certified accordingly. However, these tools are not the only ones your business can use — and many companies successfully use Puppet, Salt, Chef and other systems. <br><br>Therefore, the expertise you are looking for must not be centered on tools. Instead, it must be centered on <em>processes</em> like system design, cloud infrastructure management, software architecture planning, code deployment, monitoring and alerting, database management, etc. <br><br>In addition, the attitudes and soft skills matter a lot — as your team must be comfortable working with remote contractors and not be treated as useless freeloaders because they do not have the needed DevOp expertise yet. Warm and professional attitude forms productive long-term partnerships — and this is an important component to look for in IT outsourcing expertise.</li><li><b>Tolerance</b>. True professionals are quite often misanthropes who despise the people that do something inefficiently. It is easy for DevOps providers to obtain this attitude — as the demand for their services is quite high and most businesses out there are still only planning their DevOps transformation.<br><br>A good DevOps company will never adopt this attitude and will not point out the inefficient processes or performance bottlenecks as your fault. Instead, they will as for the reasons for such a decision and propose ways to improve the situation.</li><li><b>Modesty. </b>Try googling for “Most Popular open-source DevOps tools” or CI/CD tools, or monitoring tools for that matter. You will be flooded by titles and features, and selecting the most appropriate stack for your project might require investing quite a lot of time in figuring out what tools combinations will work best for you. <br><br>Due to the customers being generally not too well-informed of such details, most DevOps companies promote the tool stacks they are familiar with as being best. This is especially true for cloud service providers. Contact AWS, Google Cloud or Azure and ask their support representative for an estimated solution for your project. You can be sure the suggested infrastructure will be composed of vendor-specific tools and services. This is natural, as AWS support engineers know AWS products best, etc.<br><br>However, this a direct way to vendor lock-in and overpayment. Instead, a good DevOps company will suggest several possible infrastructure designs (mostly using open-source tools) and explain what are the benefits and downsides of each. This way you will be able to choose what fits YOU best.</li></ul>



<p>Thus said, we compiled a list of 15 best remote companies worldwide that gained a reputation for themselves not only through the number of projects they accomplished or the brands they worked with — but through their empathy, tolerance, open-mindedness, expertise and, most importantly, modesty — as there is nothing worse than showoffs who promise to be Jacks of all trades and fail the project. This list includes top-rated remote DevOps companies with multiple positive customer reviews, ratings from independent technology consultancy companies and a wide portfolio of successful business cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span id="more-7406"></span>
<!--noteaser-->



<p>IT Svit works with a variety of projects from different industries, helping companies of all sizes design and implement solutions for various business challenges. Most of our customers use AWS or want to move there, so our DevOps engineers have ample experience with building, optimizing and managing AWS infrastructures for projects of varying scale. It was recently proven once more, as Alex, our DevOps Engineer, received his “AWS Certified Solutions Architect &#8211; Associate” certification.</p>



<p>Why would a business need its employees to be AWS-certified? Because by successfully passing AWS certification exams our DevOps engineers provide credible proof of their expertise with AWS and ability to solve various business challenges using AWS architecture management best practices.</p>



<p>Alex was working on a variety of projects involving AWS infrastructure and services like EC2, S3, RDS, CodePipeline, CloudWatch, Route53 and multiple others. He helped an international micro-financing company configure seamless updates for their application. He configured automated deployment, backups and restoration of blockchain wallets for a cryptocurrency company. He has configured real-time monitoring and smart alerting for various projects and has experience with containerizing apps using Docker and running them on Kubernetes clusters in AWS. Therefore, it was logical for Alex to become an AWS-certified Solutions Architect.</p>



<p>For the company, this means one more step towards obtaining a sufficient number of certifications and receiving an AWS certified partner status.</p>



<h2>AWS exam preparation and training</h2>



<p>The prerequisites for attempting the AWS Solutions Architect — Associate exam are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>1+ year of practical experience in building systems using Amazon Web Services</li><li>firsthand work experience in using various AWS products</li><li>solid background in infrastructure management and application deployment</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, all of these are quite easily obtained by simply working as a DevOps engineer.</p>



<p>However, the exam consists of 55 questions covering various aspects of AWS products, including the ones you might not have been actively using. Thus said, attempting to pass it without preliminary preparation is not recommended, regardless of your background and experience, so it’s better to be over-prepared than underprepared.</p>



<p>There is a wide variety of information available to an aspiring DevOps engineer, from AWS FAQs to various online courses:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/ec2/faqs/">Amazon EC2</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/s3/faqs/">Amazon S3</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/rds/faqs/">Amazon RDS</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/vpc/faqs/">Amazon VPC</a></li></ul>



<p>For example, <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate">A Cloud Guru</a> provides a good course covering all the topics you need to know in order to pass the AWS Solutions Architect — Associate exam. You can watch them at your own pace in the evenings or during the week-ends. Dedicating 8 hours a week would allow you to finish the course in under a month.</p>



<p>Another excellent resource is a detailed guide by Joe Baron, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Official-Study/dp/1119138558">‘AWS Certified Solutions Architect Official Study Guide: Associate Exam’</a> available at Amazon. Aside from helping you prepare for an examination, it can become your deskbook regarding AWS architecture design and implementation best practices.</p>



<p>Finally, there are multiple <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aws/videos/all">Twitch videos covering AWS</a>-related topics, as well as an official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AWSwebinars/videos">AWS Webinar on Youtube</a>. You will find them highly informative and instructive.</p>



<p>Once you are sure you are ready for the exam — you request the attempt and schedule your visit to an AWS certification center near you. Such centers in Ukraine work in Kyiv, Lviv and Kharkiv, and you can request an online exam trial attempt. </p>



<p>At the appointed date and time, you go to the certification center and must confirm your identity by providing 2 personal IDs — a passport and a driving license or a personal banking card, for example.</p>



<p>When you confirm your identity, you receive a list of 55 questions you should answer in 80 minutes. All of them are covered in the official documentation or can be answered based on your practical experience with designing and managing the AWS infrastructure. Once the time is up, your answers are taken to be checked. If you pass the exam successfully — your PDF certificate and badge are emailed to you in a couple of days. If not — you have more time to prepare and pass the exam next time.</p>



<h2><b>Benefits for IT Svit and Clients</b></h2>



<p>As IT Svit is a provider of end-to-end solutions for businesses from multiple industries, we must be able to solve various types of challenges. As most of the customers prefer working with the AWS cloud platform, proving our expertise with using it is a good way to gain customer trust.</p>



<p>For Alex, this certification is a good milestone in his career. It is valid for 3 years only, but Alex is surely going to improve his knowledge and skillset. Therefore, he will take the next certification at a higher level, further increasing his value as a professional. The immediate benefit was the possibility to structure the knowledge Alex already had and to lay the grounds for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of AWS systems. There are various other benefits of AWS certification, including:</p>



<ul><li>Personal AWS-certified badge to use in your CV, on your website or any other platform</li><li>Access to the training materials required to pass the next level of AWS exams</li><li>Access to multiple resources for increasing your theoretical knowledge of AWS infrastructure and services</li><li>A chance to get invited to select AWS events. While this is more useful for the US citizens, visiting the AWS Certification lounge at annual AWS re:Invent and networking with other AWS professionals from across the globe can be a very emboldening and empowering experience for any DevOps engineer.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">AWS certification</a> and its benefits are covered in detail on the AWS website. IT Svit continues to grow our expertise and more AWS certifications are sure to follow until we rightfully become an AWS-certified Managed DevOps Services Provider.</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/it-svit-proves-its-technological-expertise-with-aws-certification/">IT Svit proves its technological expertise with AWS certification</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span id="more-7245"></span>
<!--noteaser-->



<p>There are various reasons for IT outsourcing, as businesses can delegate some tasks to reliable contractors and concentrate on core expertise instead. Ukraine is a long-term partner and one of the most preferable IT outsourcing destinations for the EU and US businesses. In 2020, another compelling reason for Ukrainians to work at home is the ever-strengthening currency, as Ukrainian hryvnya has strengthened 19% in 2019.</p>



<p>The benefits of working with an IT outsourcing company for an EU or US business are numerous:</p>



<ul><li>instant access to a pool of highly skilled software engineers,&nbsp;</li><li>significant reduction of time-to-market for new product features,&nbsp;</li><li>reduction of risks related to software development, like tighter deadlines,</li><li>higher software development quality (fewer mistakes and bugs),&nbsp;</li><li>lower expenses on salaries and infrastructure operations,</li><li>legal coverage due to SLA and NDA.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ItSvit_2020_list_2-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7246"/></figure>



<p>This applies to work with any IT services provider across the globe, though. Why do we say Ukraine is the best choice for finding a reliable IT outsourcing partner?</p>



<ul><li><b>A huge pool of skilled talents</b>. Ukraine has a fairly developed system of higher education and many universities there produce students with a high level of theoretical technology knowledge. Later, these people become Junior IT specialists and quickly grow into Middle and Seniors. According to estimates from DOU, the leading Ukrainian IT-related portal, there are approximately 160,000 software developers and DevOps engineers in Ukraine as of 2019.</li><li><b>Large number of experienced professionals</b>. Out of these 160,000 IT specialists, nearly 35% are Juniors and approximately 30% fall to Middle and Senior level talents respectively. Thus said, most of Ukrainian IT outsourcing companies can quickly form the required teams for any project requirements and complexity.</li><li><b>Fluent English</b>. Being the language of international communication, English is extremely important in IT outsourcing. Most Ukrainian IT professionals can speak English fluently or at least at the Intermediate level, which is enough to ensure transparent and frictionless business communication.</li><li><b>Overlapping time zones</b>. The Ukrainian time zone is GMT +2:00, so it mostly overlaps with the EU business time and covers most of the US evening. This makes it very convenient for the US and UK businesses, as the tasks can be done and discussed at once for Europeans or will be done overnight for the US businesses. This speeds up software development considerably.</li><li><b>Cultural fit</b>. Ukraine is a European country with a Westernized culture and mindset, so Ukrainians celebrate Christian religious holidays and these are not too numerous. Thus said, Ukrainian teams have a good cultural fit with the US and EU customers and can ensure the projects roll out according to a schedule.</li><li><b>Polished workflows and ready solutions</b>. Many Ukrainian companies have 5+ years of IT outsourcing expertise under their belts. This means these teams have polished workflows and established processes, which ensures timely delivery of required services and products. Most importantly, while each project is unique, accomplishing multiple similar projects helps identify common challenges and prepare solutions for them. Thus said, experienced IT outsourcing companies in Ukraine can deliver software products and solutions much quicker, as they don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time.</li></ul>



<p>To sum it up, some companies in Ukraine can become one-stop shops for all your IT-related needs and tasks. The companies that can provide the full cycle of IT services for businesses of all sizes are called <a href="https://themanifest.com/it-services/msp/companies">Managed Services Providers</a>, and they are able to deliver end-to-end solutions for various aspects of IT operations — from MVP development and automated QA to seamless software releases and real-time monitoring.</p>



<p>IT Svit is one of such companies and a <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/ukraine/leaders-matrix">leader of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine</a>, so we know the situation in the Ukrainian IT industry firsthand. And we see that 2019 was marked by a significant increase in the variety and quantity of Ukrainian IT outsourcing projects and startups. Grammarly, the world’s most popular grammar checker was one of the <a href="https://www.lift99.co/blog/ukraines-top-startups-launching-the-wall-of-fame">top 15 Ukrainian startups that launched the Wall of Fame in 2019</a>.</p>



<p>Thus said, instead of aiming to relocate to Western European countries, more and more Ukrainians prefer to work and start their business in Ukraine, which is proven by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/world-s-best-performing-currency-cools-ukrainians-lust-to-leave">Bloomberg’s research on the currency strengthening rate in 2019</a>. As hryvnya (UAH), the national currency strengthened 19% in 2019, more jobs became much more competitive in Ukraine and even the specialists that emigrated previously prefer to go back and work in Ukraine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ItSvit_2020_conclusion_3-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7248"/></figure>



<h2>Final thoughts: what does 2020 have in stock for the Ukrainian IT outsourcing business?</h2>



<p>IT Svit develops our own product — <a href="https://hurma.work/en/">HURMA System</a>, an end-to-end platform for recruitment and HR management processes, and it has nearly 400 customers a year after the release. With 80%+ of our customers being IT companies, mostly IT outsourcing providers, we keep the hand on the pulse of the IT industry. A significant portion of our customers has doubled their service packages over this year, meaning their teams grow rapidly — as the numbers of their contracts grow.</p>



<p>We are sure 2020 will continue to bring new partnership possibilities between US and EU businesses and Ukrainian IT outsourcing companies. With the stabilization of the UAH exchange rate and growth of the Ukrainian economy, ever more mutually beneficial contracts are sure to emerge. As for IT Svit, we are always ready to lend our DevOps and software development expertise to a company of any size from any industry to help you reach the business objectives set. Contact us today and let’s start working on your next project tomorrow!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/why-2020-is-a-great-time-for-it-outsourcing-to-ukraine/">Why 2020 is a great time for IT outsourcing to Ukraine</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT Svit is a <a href="https://clutch.co/profile/it-svit">client-oriented</a> company and we are trying to keep meeting with our partners all the time. In September we’ve planned to visit the heart of Germany – Berlin. At first, we decided to visit our long-term Germany partners <a href="https://www.miceportal.com/">MICE Portal GmbH</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalsamba.com">Digital Samba</a>. MICE Portal GmbH is a web-based event platform. Digital Samba is a great platform for video communication like webinars, meetings, video-lessons, etc. We also wanted to visit a few meetups, one of them being a great B2B Meetup on September 19. We were there and want to share our impressions below.</p>



<span id="more-7008"></span>



<p>Actually, the very first thing to discuss is the German IT business at all. There are a lot of startups in Germany and they often need qualified IT specialists in different areas – from developers for a small mobile app to DevOps engineers for huge cloud infrastructure. The main problem of startups is limited investments. People with great ideas can’t invest huge sums in the project, so there is always a question: “How to invest in the most efficient way?”. That’s why startups need to find a balance between quality and expenses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="186" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_Berlin_Logo_3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7011"/></figure>



<p>We can say both us and our clients know the answer. It is outsourcing IT services to Ukraine. We’ve talked to our German clients and asked them <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/can-hiring-dedicated-team-ukraine-help-german-startup/">why they chose Ukraine</a>. The common reasons are the following:</p>



<ul><li>Ukrainian IT talents speak English fluently, which simplifies the communication;</li><li>Ukrainian companies occupy top places in worldwide ratings like <a href="https://clutch.co/it-services/msp">Clutch</a>;</li><li>the main part of Ukrainian talents is Middle and Senior specialists, also there are a lot of Juniors who are growing fast;</li><li>if you need to have live communication, you can meet your Ukrainian team in <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/dedicated-team-2-hours-away/">two hours</a> and we’re always open to business trips to our clients;</li><li>overlapping time zones allow your outsourcing team to be available during your working hours.</li></ul>



<p>Another important reason is investments. Ukrainian IT sector is more cost-efficient than German with the same level of quality. It is based on different causes, but in fact, outsourcing is more cost-efficient.</p>



<p>Going back to our trip, we want to mention that Berlin is a great modern multicultural city with convenient infrastructure, pleasant people and fabulous history. We were afraid of our lack of understanding of the German language, but fortunately, there is no language barrier if you know English. The city infrastructure is so convenient that you can download a few applications (maps, carsharing, kick scooters, etc.) and meet all the transportation and transfer needs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="275" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_Berlin_Logo_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7012"/></figure>



<p>Our partner MICE Portal GmbH recommended East Berlin, so we stayed there. This is a developing district with multiple coworking places where you can meet like-minded people for a cup of coffee. We are glad to notice that a lot of German companies are working with Ukrainian IT specialists.</p>



<p>So, we have met more than ten companies, but the most important were meetings with our partners and visiting a meetup. That&#8217;s why let&#8217;s go back to the B2B meetup.</p>



<p>This event was organized by DB mindbox Berlin, the startup hub that gives young companies the opportunity to accomplish their ideas and products. Also, there were great speakers and lecturers like:</p>



<ul><li>Manuel – the co-founder of Nexoya, a company focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis. Manuel holds leading positions in several companies in the field of business applications and entrepreneurship.</li><li>Damir – the Senior Business Development Manager at Navigine – the global provider of integrated positioning mobile technologies.</li><li>Taziana – the Business Development Representative, at&nbsp; Bee Talents, a dynamically growing company, shared her ample experience in recruitment and best practices of IT headhunting.</li></ul>



<p>All the speakers shared their extensive experience, successful cases and examples from real projects. Besides interesting talks, this meetup was a great place for networking and finding new partners.</p>



<p>Also, we visited the presentation of the electric cars, where we met great hi-tech specialists like automotive designers, product architects and others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="393" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_Berlin_conclusion_4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7010"/></figure>



<p>Summing up, we had a pleasant trip experience. It was great to meet our long-term clients in person and get acquainted with lots of talents, co-founders and startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are absolutely sure that a personal meeting is key to success, so we have already planned our next trip to Germany. This time we will visit Munich and Dortmund, so if you would like to discuss your projects – we would be glad to meet you!</p>
