					<description><![CDATA[<p>While people often discuss AI, they can rarely describe how some algorithm works or what it can be used for. We provide a brief summary and use cases for Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Deep Learning</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/demystified-ai-machine-learning-deep-learning/">Demystified: AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people regard the terms Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) as synonyms. This is actually quite far from the truth, and today we demystify these misconceptions.</p>
<p><span id="more-4819"></span></p>
<p>AI, ML, and DL are the practical applications of various data analysis models and algorithms for various <span id="cases">use cases</span> in different industries. While these tools cannot yet make moral choices or act as sentient machines, they hold the potential to drive more value for any business. This is done by finding previously unseen patterns and predicting the possible outcomes of certain actions. We hope this article will provide a better understanding of the AI, ML and DL capabilities, and will become your starting point in a journey towards AI-powered data analytics.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4828" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_industries.png" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL use cases" width="1200" height="421" /> The first step along this way was done through <span id="expert">expert</span> systems, which were the first attempt to codify the processes of the data analysis. Experts explained the rules of some domain expertise, these were later codified in rules engines and used to answer the questions. However, this structure was able to work only according to these predefined rules and could not improve over time. Keeping the rules engines up-to-date as new facts are added is also a cumbersome and effort-consuming endeavor. However, expert systems are still quite widespread in healthcare and finances.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4832 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_expert_systems.png" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL expert systems" width="1000" height="421" /> The next step towards machine learning was made when the modern computer CPU architecture was introduced, followed by Graphic Processor Units (<span id="GPUs">GPUs</span>). The core benefit of GPUs is that they enable parallel data processing due to housing thousands of smaller cores, as opposed to serial processing in several larger cores of CPUs. The further evolution of this technology and <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-becomes-synonym-cloud-computing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">transition to the cloud</a> of all data-intensive projects had lead to a significant boom in AI development.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4826 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_tech.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL technology" width="663" height="421" /> In addition, using the <a href="https://itsvit.com/big-data/2017-review-big-data-projects-tools/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span id="big data">Big Data</span> tools</a> like Hadoop, Spark, Flink, Map Reduce and <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-5-reasons-use-apache-cassandra-database/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cassandra</a> ensures the businesses leverage their Big Data capabilities to the max. Previously, the data was stored somewhere and had to be uploaded elsewhere to be processed. This caused the data transfer speed to be the bottleneck and was quite expensive. The modern-day approach means storing the data in the cloud and directing the processing to the data, not the other way around. This is much more cost-effective, not to mention being much faster.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4825" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_system-structure.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL system structure" width="1200" height="675" /></p>
<h2><span id="ai">What is AI</span>: something great that doesn’t work just yet</h2>
<p>We have already published an article explaining that <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-coming-not-sentient-robots/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AI is not coming in form of sentient robots</a>. As a matter of fact, AI has been an umbrella term and buzzword ever since the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Turing test</a>. Scientists were striving to create the intellect in the machine, but this should not have been a copy of human intellect.</p>
<p><b>AI is a set of algorithms that learn and evolve over time, becoming better and better in dealing with their task, but are incapable of moral choices (don’t know what is good or bad) or understanding the value of art, or receiving an aesthetic pleasure from music.</b></p>
<p>Actually, AI is now more of a codename for a new frontier in the minds of men. Every new aspect of mathematical theory gains its practical implementation and stops being an AI. This phenomenon was described by Ted Dunning, Ph.D., Chief Application Architect at MapR (enterprise Hadoop vendor), who said that “<b>when something does not work &#8211; we call it AI. When it begins to work right — we call it something else</b>.”</p>
<h2><span id="ml">What is Machine Learning</span>: AI applied to Big Data Analytics</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is the subset of AI technology that boomed around 1980s. Its main application is the ever-increasing quality and precision of big data analysis. The ML algorithms find patterns in the historical data and the trained ML models follow these patterns to predict the valuable insights in new data.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4823 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_logic.png" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL logic" width="1027" height="500" /></p>
<p>There are two main subdomains of the ML learning domain: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Supervised learning</b> uses data labels (both the income and the output data are provided to the algorithm) created by humans to structure the data. The ML models in this category include random decision forests, naive Bayes algorithms, SVM, and linear or logistic regression training.</li>
<li><b>Unsupervised learning</b> uses unlabeled data and the ML models have to either train themselves at their own pace or apply the reinforced learning technique, which maximizes the rewards depending on feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Machine Learning is mostly leveraged for data classification and is widely used in the financial and banking industries to fight fraud and for risk management. We have described the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/5-use-cases-machine-learning-banking-industry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">use cases of machine learning in the banking industry</a> or how various businesses are <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-5-machine-learning-use-cases-financial-industry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">using machine learning to improve financial services</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="dl">Deep Learning</span>: multiple layers of neural networks</h2>
<p>Deep Learning algorithms use multiple layers of nodes with different weights, so-called Deep Neural Networks or DNNs. There are input and output nodes, and at least 10 layers between them. By adjusting the logical weight of each DNN node, the data scientists can influence the outcome, thus training the model to reach the required results at scale. Due to the development of massively parallel processing of data and the use of potent GPUs, data scientists can nowadays use the DNNs with thousands of layers.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4829" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_DNN.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL DNN example" width="1200" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Every readjustment of the logical weight results in the model better understanding the required object features. The advantage of this process is that the features can be not defined in the beginning, and the model will learn to identify the best outcome on its own with time.</p>
<p>DNNs are the most widespread but not the only types of ML algorithms used in Deep Learning.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4827 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_types.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL types" width="785" height="344" /></p>
<p>We have explained <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/short-guide-deep-learning-really-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how Deep Learning really works</a>, as well as covering multiple Deep Learning advancements made in 2017 in the areas like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">text and speech applications</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">machine perception and OCR</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/big-data/deep-learning-summary-2017-reinforced-learning-miscellaneous-apps/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reinforced learning and robotic movement apps</a>. These applications disrupt and improve the healthcare, financial and retail industries, as well as many other areas of life.</p>
<h2><span id="future">Prospects</span> of AI technology evolution</h2>
<p>Thus said, there were significant improvements in the effectiveness of AI applications over the last decade. Even though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov</a> more than 20 years ago, the next sound victory of this type happened only recently, when Google DeepMind’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AlphaGo won vs the active Go champion Lee Sedol</a> in 2016. This does not mean the AI development has stalled — quite contrary, it boomed significantly.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4885" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_evolution.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL evolution" width="1200" height="589" /><span id="from">From</span> sci-fi excitement of the early 1950s and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Dreams" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dreams of sentient robots</a>, we came to realize that AI is best used to automate laborious and time-consuming tasks at scale, not to imitate the functions of the human brain. Certain similarities between the natural and artificial intelligence still remain, like in <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/loihi-self-learning-chip-intel/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Loihi, the self-learning chip from Intel</a>. However, recent technological advancements underpin the potent trend of employing ML algorithms for large-scale data analysis.</p>
<h2><span id="conclusions">Final thoughts</span> on AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>
<p>Is <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/future-ai-deep-learning-much/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Learning the direction the AI will evolve</a>? We think not, as there are new exciting applications constantly appearing on the cutting edge of technology, as well as the new possibilities to apply ML and DL in previously not digitalized industries. As more and more businesses complete their cloud transition, more and more prospects for leveraging the AI algorithms in Big Data analytics offer themselves.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-summit-2018-london-highlights-takeaways/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS 2018 Summit in London</a>, Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels revealed that AWS concentrates their effort in delivering AI-powered features and services for their product to further empower the value delivery for their customers. This resulted in multiple AI/ML/DL releases, announcements and features presented during the recent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/aws/aws-previews-and-pre-announcements-at-reinvent-2018-andy-jassy-keynote/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS </a>re:Invent 2018 week.</p>
<p>Microsoft does the same, housing an 8,000-people-strong R&amp;D department wholly dedicated to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/one-year-later-microsoft-ai-research-grows-8k-people-massive-bet-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">developing AI and ML services for Azure</a>. AI is definitely hotter than ever nowadays and will become ever more profitable and useful in future.</p>
<p>Did you implement the ML models to your data analytics systems already? Would you like to do it?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In one of our recent articles we told about the advances in <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Learning text and speech applications</a>. An equally prominent domain is the DL algorithms for machine perception.<br />
<span id="more-2325"></span></p>
<p>Machine perception is the field of deep learning study related to machines not merely reading the pictures, like the computer vision does, but to also comprehending them, like perceiving the meaning of various signs, answering questions about the image content, drawing sketches, aging faces, and even protecting the websites from captcha bypassers — or fooling the face recognition systems&#8230;</p>
<h2>Google Maps improvements with OCR</h2>
<p>Google Brain team has developed a new Optical Character Recognition (OCR) <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/updating-google-maps-with-deep-learning.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">algorithm</a> to improve Google Maps and Street View services with better road sign recognition capabilities. Due to this they were able to make the road signs better visible on more than <b>80 billion</b> photographs.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2327" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_21.png" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_2" width="402" height="541" /></p>
<p>The resulting model is also able to concentrate on the shop signs automatically, filtering them out of the unneeded visual noise on the photos.</p>
<h2>Visual reasoning solved</h2>
<p>One of the less trivial tasks for a neural network includes answering a question based on the image contents. For example, the DL model must answer if there are any rubber objects sized as the metal cylinder on this picture. Previously, the rate of correct answers reached ⅔ at max.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2328" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_3" width="713" height="306" /></p>
<p>2017 showed yet another achievement for Google Deepmind team, who <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01427.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">taught their model to answer such questions correctly in 95,5% of cases</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2329" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_3.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_4" width="759" height="348" /></p>
<h2>Pix2Code: create your website layout directly from the pictures</h2>
<p>Uizard team has unveiled a great <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07962" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tool</a> that can transform the experience of website creation. Their neural network transforms the GUI screenshots into the website layout code with 77% accuracy.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2330" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_4.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_5" width="700" height="345" /></p>
<p>Though this still is the research project and the tool is not production-ready, the possibilities it promises to provide are incredible.</p>
<h2>ScetchRNN: Arithmetics in pictures drawn by the DL model</h2>
<p>Did you see a page titled <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Quick, Draw!</a>, where the visitors were tasked with drawing a picture in 20 seconds? This was a project from Google, aimed at <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2017/04/teaching-machines-to-draw.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">teaching the machines to draw</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2331" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_6.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_6" width="766" height="374" /></p>
<p>The resulting <a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data set of 70,000 vector images</a> is publicly available for training your own Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) using RNN as the encoding/decoding tool.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2332" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_22.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_7" width="812" height="285" /></p>
<p>Such algorithms can perform vector arithmetics for drawing catswines, for instance)</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2333" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_9.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_8" width="678" height="212" /></p>
<h2>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h2>
<p>2017 was a hot year in the field of GAN research, as  many researchers were able to find a much better balance between generator and discriminator networks.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2334" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_10.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_9" width="783" height="329" /></p>
<p>The result of training such a model is that it becomes able to choose the best-quality images (the most common application is selecting the best of the series of face photos, rooms or landscape photos).</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2335" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_11.png" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_10" width="630" height="319" /></p>
<p>These algorithms also excel in vector arithmetics:</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2336" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_12.png" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_11" width="621" height="375" /></p>
<h2>Face aging with GANs</h2>
<p>We are sure you noticed an eruption of face-adjusting apps, aging being the most popular ones. Make a selphie and watch your face becoming 40, 50, 60, 70, 80-years-old. This is done by introducing a configurable parameter while training a GAN, and adjusting it in the defined direction.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2337" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_13.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_12" width="780" height="502" /></p>
<p>This specific <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01983.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">face aging algorithm using GANs</a> was trained using huge collection of IMDB photos of various celebrities throughout their lives.</p>
<h2>Photo improvement</h2>
<p>Google has also been able to make another use of GAN — as a system capable of <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2017/07/using-deep-learning-to-create.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">creating and improving the professional-level photos</a>. The logic was the same, as the generator tried to improve bad photos (professional quality photos impaired using special filters), while the discriminator tried to sort them from the real world photos of professional quality.</p>
<p>The trained model then searched across a myriad of Google maps sceneries and made a variety of photos of professional or nearly professional quality.</p>
<h2>Text-based picture choice</h2>
<p>One of the most impressive cases of GANs application lies within their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05396.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ability to choose the picture describing the text fragment</a>. If the textual input is fed to both a conditional GAN generator and a discriminator GAN, the system can check if the text corresponds the picture, after being trained by consuming fake text-picture pairs.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2338" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_14.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_13" width="780" height="270" /></p>
<h2>Pix2Pix project evolution</h2>
<p>Surely you’ve heard of the late-2016 release of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pix2Pix image translation using GAN</a>. It allowed creating a map using a satellite photo or draw a building facade using labels, along with several other use cases.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2339" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_15.png" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_14" width="780" height="289" /></p>
<p>The latest release of <a href="https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pix2Pix project on GitHub</a> uses the new PatchGAN as a discriminator, where a picture is split into n parts and each one is evaluated if it is true or fake. The <a href="https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">online demo of this DL model</a> capabilities show a truly astounding potential!</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2340" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_16.png" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_15" width="693" height="349" /></p>
<h2>CycleGAN for creating a ZebraPutin!</h2>
<p>Another neat application for GANs was sitting right around the corner — what about merging the images that have no direct pairs for their domains? An unpaired image-to-image translation or <a href="https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CycleGAN</a> promises great capabilities for styling and object transfiguration.</p>

<p>The algorithm uses cyclic consistency loss, thus the title:</p>

<p>This also allows for combining data from different sets to create a realistic mapping:</p>

<h2>Cybersecurity using machine perception</h2>
<p>As you might have already known, adding some noise to the picture spoofs it for the GAN. While remaining nearly the same for the human eye, such picture causes the algorithm to go haywire:</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2347" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_25.png" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_25" width="738" height="280" /></p>
<p>Why is this important? Firstly, we can protect our websites by adding such noise to captcha and protect it from various captcha bypassing tools. Secondly, by exploiting the flaws like these the hackers can gain access to various IoT applications, like face recognition systems or self-piloting cars.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2344" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary2017_Machine_Perception_ITSvit_20.png" alt="Deep_Learning_Machine_Perception_ItSvit_21" width="587" height="317" /></p>
<p>Therefore, developing Deep Learning algorithms both capable to deliver the result and able to withstand the attack is becoming the task of utmost importance. There are several libraries already developed to attack and defend neural networks, like <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">cleverhans</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">foolbox</a>, created to participate in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/nips-2017-defense-against-adversarial-attack" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NIPS competition 2017</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusions on the machine perception developments in 2017</h2>
<p>Machine perception projects were a significant part of the Deep Learning field in 2017, opening a plethora of new capabilities. From fiddling with face aging for fun and all the way up to serious issues like website captcha protection and Google Map improvements, this year was rich with fascinating discoveries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deep Learning is disrupting many industries, and yours might not be an exception. Learn of the most notable deep learning projects of 2017 and ride the wave, or risk being rolled over…<br />
<span id="more-2297"></span></p>
<p>Deep Learning (DL) has long crossed the traditional boundaries. Various DL projects are launched in the domains from <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2017/03/assisting-pathologists-in-detecting.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">medical services</a> to insurance and from <a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/kunpeng-parameter-server-based-distributed-learning-systems-and-its-applica" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">banking to marketing</a>. For example, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/21/china-ai-world-leader-by-2030.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">China aims to become the world leader in AI and creating a $150 billion AI industry by 2030</a>, while the researchers from Baidu group boast that experiments with <a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/kunpeng-parameter-server-based-distributed-learning-systems-and-its-applica" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">datasets composed of billions of samples</a> are becoming trivial for them.</p>
<p>Thus said, every business should pay close attention to possible Deep Learning applications in their industry. We list the most discussed text and speech-related DL accomplishments of 2017 to benefit both Machine Learning professionals and sharp decision-makers who want to increase their bottom line.</p>
<h2>Text-related Deep Learning applications</h2>
<p>One of the most important areas of DL application is working with the text: translation, chatbots, text analysis and a plethora of other tasks.</p>
<h3>From Google Translate&#8230;</h3>
<p>A year ago <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google announced the launch of a new Google Translate training algorithm</a>, the Recurrent Neural Network. Over the year, Translate has progressed from producing an unreadable salad of words when attempting to translate large bricks of text, to producing almost flawless translations. The results are astonishing and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google’s DL RNN</a> only keeps improving!</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2307" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary_2017_ITSvit_5.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Text_Speech_ItSvit_5" width="1394" height="1012" /></p>
<h3>&#8230;to Facebook negotiator chatbot</h3>
<p>You might have heard a fairy tale of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/01/facebook-shuts-robots-invent-language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how Facebook developed a chatbot and shut it down due to it inventing a new language</a>. Truth be told, that DL algorithm did come up with a non-human lexicon, yet it did not stop it from accomplishing its goal. The goal was actually for the <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1686672014972296/deal-or-no-deal-training-ai-bots-to-negotiate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AI to become great at negotiations</a> aimed at splitting the inventory with the adversary (one gets the books, the other one gets the hats, etc.), particularly by mastering the textual conversation.</p>
<p>The bot was trained using a supervised recurrent network with a huge dataset of textual transcripts of real negotiations, and further polished the system using reinforced training while 2 instances of the system chatter with one another. The chatbot has mastered one of the real-life negotiation techniques, the false interest. It showed interest for the item it did not actually want and agreed to hand it over to the other party only if given the item it actually required.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b99/f8a/35f/b99f8a35f20f9b6cf72a380ae69ef66f.gif" alt="Deep_Learning_Text_Speech_ItSvit_5" /></p>
<p>Once the task was completed, the restriction to use human language was lifted, which has lead to the system inventing some new terms. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/end-to-end-negotiator" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">play with the code</a> yourself and see what happens in your case!</p>
<h2>Speech processing and generation</h2>
<p>Another important field of DL application is related to speech processing. It includes the generation of speech and music, recognition and synchronization of the lip movements, etc.</p>
<h3>DeepMind Wavenet</h3>
<p>The company behind the AlphaGo, Google Deepmind is currently developing <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WaveNet</a> — an algorithm that transforms the input text into raw audio. It shows extremely good results as compared to previous attempts. Listen to the <a href="http://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/us-english/wavenet-1.wav" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">English example</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2300" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary_2017_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Text_Speech_ItSvit_3" width="1394" height="1012" /></p>
<p>As of now, the main flaw of this network is its performance, as 1 second of audio takes 1-2 minutes to generate, yet the progress is astonishing. To say even more, the algorithm can even create piano music!  More details are available in the PDF <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Lip reading from Google DeepMind and Oxford University</h3>
<p>Yet another initiative from Google DeepMind working in conjunction with specialists from Oxford University — lip reading algorithm described in depth in their joint <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05358v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">paper</a>. This model was trained using a dataset of more than 100,000 sentences, videos and audio files, using LSTM for audio, CNN+LSTM for video, and a combination of these 2 state-vectors that generates the state characters.</p>
<p>The system works with different types of input: audio, video, audio+video, making this algorithm multicanal.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c11/479/250/c11479250da8567ec2bae3d0e9ef2a0d.gif" alt="Deep_Learning_Text_Speech_ItSvit_6" /></p>
<h3>Synchronization of the lips movement with the audio stream</h3>
<p>The University of Washington processed more than 10,000 of hours of HD records of the President Obama speeches and developed an <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/AudioToObama/siggraph17_obama.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DL algorithm capable of synchronizing the lips movement with the audio</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2310" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DL_Summary_2017_ITSvit_6.jpg" alt="Deep_Learning_Text_Speech_ItSvit_6" width="1394" height="1600" /></p>
<p>This creates immense capabilities for gaming industry and CGI movies… yet poses a disturbing concern the next presidential speech might actually be the computer-generated footage and not a real record.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Deep Learning is on the roll and new exciting projects are revealed in various domains on a regular basis. We are going to describe the advancements in machine perception, reinforced learning and miscellaneous other apps over the course of the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned for the updates!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/">Deep Learning summary for 2017: Text and Speech Applications</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence (or AI) is the goal many researchers try to reach. Many people consider Deep Learning (DL) as a synonym of AI, while it is not so. Learn how Deep Learning works!<span id="more-2286"></span></p>
<p>The confusion is mostly caused by the misunderstanding of the definitions of the key components of the process. We will briefly describe each of the basic statements so you can see the differences firsthand.</p>
<p><b>See also</b>: <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/future-ai-deep-learning-much/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The future of AI: Deep Learning… or much more?</a></p>
<p><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> was supposed to be the imitation of human consciousness and thinking process by the means of the computer code. However, despite the recent release of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/loihi-self-learning-chip-intel/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Loihi, a self-learning chip from Intel</a>, the current state of data science and AI research is far from reaching the calculational capacities of the human brain. Currently existing AI implementations are based on strict sets of rules and cannot develop individuality, always acting the way they were programmed by their developers.</p>
<p><b>Deep Learning</b> is the field within the ML domain, which encompasses operating without strict sets of rules, as the machine learning (ML) algorithm should extract the trends and patterns from the vast sets of unstructured data after accomplishing the process of supervised (guided) or unsupervised learning.</p>
<p><b>Supervised learning</b> stands for the case of labeled data inputs and outputs used in training sets. Thus said, the ML algorithm receives both the input information and the expected output of the process of calculations. If the calculations are incorrect, the ML algorithm makes the adjustments until, after many iterations, the results become acceptably correct. In real life, you are forced to choose an acceptable result on which the iterations will stop. Otherwise, the algorithm may need an infinite number of iterations (time) to achieve 100% accuracy. This type of training can be helpful in case lots of historical data is available (like the weather forecasts).</p>
<p><b>Unsupervised learning</b>, quite contrary, is the approach to training the ML model using the unstructured data sets, where the types of incoming and resulting data are not known. Such approach helps make predictions based on the currently available data. For instance, such ML model is suitable for analyzing the e-commerce website visitors and predicting what types of visitors are most likely to make an order.</p>
<p>With these terms explained, let&#8217;s move on and describe how the Deep Learning really works.</p>
<h2>The basics of Deep Learning operations</h2>
<p>The main element of a Deep Learning <b>neural network</b> is a layer of computational nodes called “neurons”. Every neuron connects to all of the neurons in the underlying layer. There are such types of layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input layer of nodes, which receives the information and transfers it to the underlying nodes</li>
<li>Hidden node layers are the ones where the computations take place</li>
<li>Output node layer where the results of the computations appear</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2288" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Deep_Learning_Guide_ITSvit_1.jpg" alt="Short_DL_Guide_ItSvit_2" width="970" height="529" /></p>
<p>The “deep learning” means the neural network is leveraging at least two hidden layers. By adding more hidden layers the researchers enable more in-depth calculations, yet deploying such networks demands immense amounts of computational power.</p>
<p>How does the algorithm work then? The thing is, each connection has its <b>weight</b> or <b>importance</b>. The initial values of weight are assigned randomly (or according to their perceived importance for the ML model training dataset creator). There is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Activation Function</a> for every neuron that evaluates the way the signal should take, just like in the real human brain. If after the data set is analyzed the results differ from the expected, the weight values for these connections are configured anew and the new iteration is run.</p>
<p>Each iteration yields some results and they differ from the expected ones. The value of the difference between the real outcomes and the AI’s calculated outcomes is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">loss function</a>. We want this function to be as close to zero as possible, meaning the ML algorithm produces the correctly calculated outcome.</p>
<p>Each time we adjust the weight of the connections between the nodes (or neurons) and run the algorithm against the data set, we can see if the next run yielded more accurate results, or did they become even less precise. The function describing how changing the connection importance affects the output accuracy is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gradient Descent</a>. By evaluating the results after each iteration, we are able to adjust the weights in small increments and understand the direction to reach the minimum.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2289" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Deep_Learning_Guide_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="Short_DL_Guide_ItSvit_3" width="970" height="598" /></p>
<p>To sum it up, in several iterations the trained Deep Learning model will produce the acceptably accurate results and will be ready to be used in production. This model might still need some calibration while in production though (as the weight of the input factors might change over time), so an experienced ML specialist (or a whole team) is needed to perform the job.</p>
<p>We hope this short guide on how Deep Learning really works will help you grasp the basics quickly. Should you have any more questions — <a href="https://itsvit.com/contacts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">feel free to ask</a>, we are always glad to help!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/short-guide-deep-learning-really-works/">Short guide on how Deep Learning really works</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever people talk of Artificial Intelligence or AI, they most likely speak of deep learning (DL). Yes, the results of applying deep learning approach in analyzing data can be astounding.<br />
<span id="more-1684"></span></p>
<p>DL is a part of <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphagos-next-move/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AlphaGo project that won the Go game</a> against the current world champion. DL lies in the foundation of multiple services and projects that occupy the headlines of mass media. Sounds great, yeah? The problem is, DL is but a small part of Machine Learning (ML), and ML is but a small part of the greater AI industry.</p>
<p><b>Deep learning</b> is a machine learning technique, which relies on learning data representations, unlike task-specific machine learning algorithms. While deep learning can be supervised or unsupervised, it definitely excels in analyzing unstructured data according to pre-configured parameters and statistics, providing a great degree of precision in evaluating the incoming data.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1686" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Future_of_AI_DL_itsvit_2.jpg" alt="Future_of_AI_DL_itsvit_2" width="1000" height="418" /></p>
<p>Let’s imagine you have a canned vegetable factory that produces pickles, tomato juice, canned tomatoes, tomato paste and beans in tomato sauce. Raw vegetables have to be sorted to decide if the tomatoes are ripe enough to be used as a source for paste or can be only used for making conserve. Cucumbers must also be sorted, as too big cannot be used for pickles. Previously, sorting the raw materials would be a task for a special department with experienced employees. Nowadays, a single machine using deep learning algorithm deals with the task.</p>
<p>This is but one example of deep learning implementation. Just name any monotonous job that requires sorting the incoming flow of data — and deep learning will be your best bet to automate it. However, several concerns arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>DL algorithm can sort only the data it was taught to sort. It can recognize images with cars easily and distinguish them from boats, for example, but a picture of amphibious transport can break the logic. In addition, the algorithm cannot initiate a full-scale training itself, so it will never be able to recognize a pattern it was not trained to recognize.</li>
<li>DL algorithm relies heavily on the quantity and quality of the data used for initial training. For example, if the initial data set was comprised of <b>30</b> books depicting the terror and horrors of the World War II and <b>70</b> examples of “Mein Kampf”, this algorithm would become a full-scale Nazi, because the sources stating that “fascism is great” would be more than <b>2</b> times more numerous than the sources stating the opposite. Thus said, the results of the DL training greatly depend on the moral and ethical preferences of the creator of the data set used for the algorithm training.</li>
<li>DL algorithm risks greatly to fall into “overfitting problem”. There should be no upper limit to the recognition accuracy level, but this might lead to many valid results being dismissed due to not meeting some of the parameters. What human eye would easily recognize as an Albino negroid might become a nightmare for a DL algorithm, in case it was not taught some negroids can have white hair and red eyes.</li>
<li>DL algorithms cannot present the reasons for their decisions. They can only state if something is red, round, baked or wooden, but not describe the logical chain that led to the conclusion. They also cannot tell good from bad, right from wrong, etc. This means DL cannot be used when issuing decisions that impact human lives, financial transactions, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the unprecedented power the DL holds, it can be used for quite a limited range of activities, actually. But what is the AI then?</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1687" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Future_of_AI_DL_itsvit_3.jpg" alt="Future_of_AI_DL_itsvit_3" width="1000" height="418" /></p>
<p><b>The AI</b> depicted by sci-fi authors and movie directors (like in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot_(film)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I, Robot</a>) is an autonomous computing system capable of making decisions in the situations of uncertainty. It should be capable of unsupervised learning, explaining its decisions and making correct moral choices.</p>
<p>Deep learning is obviously not a match for a true AI. Luckily, as DL is but 1% of Machine learning, there are a plethora of <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/08/10-algorithms-machine-learning-engineers.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">other algorithms</a>. The combination of DL and other algorithms or, perhaps a totally new algorithm not widely known nowadays, will be the source of the true AI we hope to see in the future. What are the reasons that slow down the progress of AI development then? We shortly list them below:</p>
<ul>
<li>True AI training demands literally unlimited stores of data, the ones very few companies can provide (Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and… that’s pretty much it). AI developers can only hope to invent a promising algorithm and sell it to one of the big players, like the 2016 <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/googles-400-million-acquisition-of-deepmind-is-looking-good-2016-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deepmind $600 million acquisition by Google</a>.</li>
<li>AI development requires essential financial investments, which means only the aforementioned big players can have the sufficient resources to test the algorithms at large enough scale. Bloomberg cites Peter Lee, Microsoft’s Head of Research, saying <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-01-27/the-race-to-buy-the-human-brains-behind-deep-learning-machines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a seven-figure salary is an appropriate reward for a world-class deep learning expert</a>.</li>
<li>Presenting the explanations of the decision-making process is essential. If the algorithm cannot explain the logical chain of conclusions that lead to making a decision, the result cannot be considered trustworthy. For example, there was a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03556" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">study</a> conducted by Virginia Tech University specialists, described in details in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/12/12158238/first-click-deep-learning-algorithmic-black-boxes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Verge article</a>.The computer algorithm was provided with an image of a bedroom with blinds and asked what was covering the windows. The algorithm checked the floor, found the bed, understood the room was the bedroom and answered: blinds. However, it never paid attention to the windows in the first place, it just happened so the majority of bedroom images in its database has had blinds on windows. But what if there were no blinds on the image?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, a responsible AI we can trust with the important decision-making is yet to be developed, with deep learning being merely a part of the process and not the most important one.</p>
