										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have definitely heard about <a href="https://itsvit.com/services/devops/devops-transformation/">DevOps transformation</a> and the benefits it can bring to your business. You know it all, yes? About cost-reduction due to transition to the cloud platforms, streamlined software delivery and reduced time-to-market due to implementation of CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) workflows and a general increase in productivity due to DevOps culture of collaboration and communication between teams.</p>



<span id="more-6934"></span>



<p>There actually is much more to DevOps than an average article will tell you. However, in order to understand these depths, you must deal with much more complicated tasks, like building immutable infrastructure, enabling predictive and prescriptive Big Data analytics, training Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms, enabling serverless operations, etc. Average companies can’t do this on their own, but they can order such projects from cloud vendors like AWS, GCP or MS Azure — or from Managed Services Providers, like IT Svit.</p>



<p>What are the benefits of more complex DevOps workflows? We will explain this below, based on our experience as one of the leaders of the IT outsourcing market in Ukraine and one of the top 10 Managed Services Providers worldwide.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="752" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_DevOps-transformation_2-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6939" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_DevOps-transformation_2-8.png 752w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_DevOps-transformation_2-8-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></figure>



<h2>Why do you need a DevOps transformation?</h2>



<p>We all know what a Git-based workflow looks like. A developer writes a batch of code on their IDE and throws it over the wall to QA engineer for testing. If a testing environment with the required parameters is readily available, the QA specialist can start testing the code at once, if not — he has to ask an Ops engineer to configure the required testing environment. If an Ops engineer does not have anything else to do (which is very unlikely), he will configure the environment at once.</p>



<p>Otherwise, it will be put into the queue with the rest of the tasks (in the best-case scenario, where a ticket will be created). In the worst-case scenario, the request will be a message in a chat, which will be overlooked or quickly forgotten, so that the configuration will start with some delay, and the testing will start with a significant delay as a result. Once the testing is done, the code is thrown over the wall back to the developer for bug fixing. Rinse, repeat. Release updates once or twice a year, enjoy post-release crashes, hotfixes and other attributes of Waterfall project management.</p>



<p>This nightmare is well-known to all enterprise-grade software vendors and customers:</p>



<ul><li>workflow rigidity, so new features cannot be added mid-development</li><li>exceeded deadlines, so that releases are quite slow-paced</li><li>features become outdated faster than they are released</li><li>products have very little interoperability</li><li>servers have limited resources and can lag during peak loads</li><li>long customer feedback loops</li><li>frustrated customers, who finally switch out to more flexible competitors</li></ul>



<p>The Agile methodology of software delivery was intended to solve these challenges and DevOps culture, which is the practical implementation of Agile, was introduced to provide the tooling and workflows to make this possible.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="395" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_DevOps-culture_3-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6938" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_DevOps-culture_3-8.png 753w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_DevOps-culture_3-8-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure>



<h2>DevOps culture: don’t mix the teams, fix the mindsets</h2>



<p>DevOps culture is actually quite hard to define with a single phrase. An inexperienced explanation would describe it as “<em>mixing the Devs, the QA and the Ops engineers to form all-around capable teams that handle the whole process of software delivery</em>”. This is what a person would say, who has little practical experience and understanding of what DevOps actually is. Here is how IT Svit, a Managed Services Provider with 14+ years of expertise defines DevOps culture:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>DevOps methodology is a set of software delivery tools and best practices, used to combine the Dev and Ops parts of the software development lifecycle to ensure maximum performance, speed and reliability of all IT operations, workflows and pipelines to ensure uninterrupted positive end-user experience and achievement of business goals.</p></blockquote>



<p>Thus said, the product life cycle is 90% production environment management. It would be simply strange to not take it into consideration when planning the software architecture and developing the product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, our DevOps workflows follow the motto of “<b><em>you built it — you run it</em></b>”, instead of throwing the responsibility for the product performance over the wall. When we engage in a new project, our DevOps system architects discuss the best ways to operate the future product or system and ensure its optimal performance. This way, the DevOps engineers help design the CI/CD pipelines needed to turn EVERY code commit into a new product build version. This is possible due to such DevOps principles:</p>



<ul><li><b>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</b> — approach to infrastructure configuration and management, when every desired environment state is codified in textual settings files, so-called “manifests”. These manifests are processed by Terraform and Kubernetes tools and are versioned like any other code — and are launched as simply. This way, once the manifest is configured by a DevOps engineer, it can be easily launched by the developer or QA engineer. IaC also ensures that the code operates in the same environment all the way from the IDE to production, to remove the “works on my machine” byword every software engineer hates.</li><li><b>Continuous Integration (CI) </b>— simple infrastructure provisioning due to IaC enables the developers to use automated unit testing, so each new batch of code can be tested at once after the commit. This allows the teams to deliver the code in short batches and make multiple new builds of the product each day — and even turn them into releases, should they need to. This is the reason for Google Chrome, Telegram App or Facebook to update nearly every time you launch them — they finish a sprint a day. Thus said, instead of developing a new product feature for a long time in its own long repo branch, CI allows to develop in short branches, test automatically and integrate new features into the main project trunk continuously and seamlessly.</li><li><b>Continuous Delivery (CD)</b> — multiple DevOps tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, Gitlab CI, Ansible and others help automate most of the routine software delivery and cloud infrastructure management operations, by turning the output of one operation into the input for another operation.<br>This way the code can automatically pass all stages of the software delivery:<ul><li>written in IDE and tested using the automated unit and integrity tests</li><li>committed from IDE to the project repo, </li><li>built and tested in the testing environment, </li><li>moved to staging environment in case of success, </li><li>tested by QA for regression and user acceptance, </li><li>released to production in case of success using rolling updates to avoid downtime</li><li>run and monitored in production.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Continuous Delivery also helps to greatly speed up and simplify the production infrastructure management, as most of the operations can be completely automated. They must not necessarily be cloud-based, as the Kubernetes cluster can be configured atop bare-metal servers or deployed to an on-prem virtualized solution like OpenStack and OpenShift.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_DevOps-benefits_4-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6937" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_DevOps-benefits_4-8.png 753w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_DevOps-benefits_4-8-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure>



<h2>DevOps benefits: cloud, Docker containers, microservices, API interoperability</h2>



<p>Thus said, DevOps workflows require virtualized infrastructure to run, so public cloud like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform is their natural habitat. However, many banking and financial enterprise-grade businesses prefer to run their on-prem cloud systems to ensure data security and operational proficiency. Nevertheless, most of the startups are perfectly fine with developing and running their products on public cloud platforms.</p>



<p>Another important pillar of DevOps success is containerization. When your apps are running inside Docker containers — envelopes of code, containing all the needed runtime environment — your apps run exactly the same for all the customers. Besides, rebooting a container is much simpler than rebooting a virtual machine or a server, which dramatically increases the system resilience under heavy workloads.</p>



<p>The next benefit of DevOps workflows is the ability to split monolithic application into microservices, which communicate through APIs. This way, each product feature can be run as a separate microservice, developed independently, configured and updated without affecting the performance of the rest of the product, etc. Besides, as the microservices interoperate with each other through APIs, they can be connected to third-party modules the same way. Thus said, microservices and APIs make integration with other apps much simpler.</p>



<p>With the cloud transition finished, DevOps workflows and CI/CD pipelines established, all the shortcomings of Waterfall software development are dealt with:</p>



<ul><li>workflow becomes flexible and new features can be added to the project in any of biweekly releases</li><li>predictable delivery schedule and timely releases</li><li>shorter time-to-market for new features, ensuring competitive edge for your business</li><li>monolithic apps are split to microservices that interact through APIs, so your product can be quite easily integrated with other parts of the software ecosystem</li><li>cloud computing resources are scalable, so the apps always perform well</li><li>customer feedback becomes a crucial source of input for product evolution and can be implemented in several weeks, not years</li><li>uninterrupted positive end-user experience, leading to increased customer loyalty and brand advocacy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Most of the businesses consider their business goals achieved once the DevOps transformation we described above is complete. However, there is much more capabilities with DevOps — and now we go in deeper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="753" height="394" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_Improved-DevOps-capabilities_5-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6940" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_Improved-DevOps-capabilities_5-8.png 753w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ItSvit_In-depth-approach-to-DevOps_Improved-DevOps-capabilities_5-8-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure>



<h2><b>Improved DevOps capabilities for your business</b></h2>



<p>Once your systems start working, you begin accumulating a trove of machine-generated and user-submitted data. This data can be incredibly beneficial for your business — and again, not in a way an average Big Data prophet would tell you. Forget about “pouring all your incoming data streams into a single data lake and then applying BI algorithms to uncover hidden patterns”. Big Data does not work that way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The way it actually works is — specifically trained Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms can determine normal system behavior in your data streams or normalize and visualize huge volumes of information contained in a variety of data types. Once these models are trained on historical data, they can be used to monitor the system performance and detect abnormal patterns (like a spike in system load, a beginning of a DDoS attack or a cybersecurity breach) real-time to allows your IT team to react immediately and minimize the damage or fully prevent it.</p>



<p>This application of Big Data analytics is called AiOps and operates under two major paradigms: <b>predictive and prescriptive analytics</b>. When using predictive analytics, an AI algorithm learns the normal system operation patterns, most common issues and the best response scenarios. For example, if you are running a eCommerce platform, and the peak of usage is between 5 and 8 p.m. UTC, you might want to scale the system up (spin up more instances) to deal with the load, and scale it down (terminate the instances) once the peak is gone.</p>



<p>Such a scenario can be configured even using your cloud platform admin dashboard. However, automated scenario will work every time, even when it is not needed — like during a holiday season, when most of the activity ceases — so it must be adjusted frequently. Quite the contrary, a trained Machine Learning model will recommend the DevOps engineer to spin up additional instances only when the CPU load will go up (even if it happens outside of usual peak time) and stop them once the peak load is over. This is what <b>predictive analytics</b> does, and it is much more cost-efficient and helps save a ton of effort on constant manual system monitoring and adjustment.</p>



<p><b>Prescriptive analytics</b> works in a similar way, it just makes another step further and operates the infrastructure autonomously, only alerting the DevOps engineers when something unidentified is going on. This results in so called “<b>self-healing infrastructure</b>” where a failure of any container will result only in alerting the appropriate person, forming an error log with a screenshot and rebooting the faulty container without stopping the system operations even for a second. IT Svit has configured such systems for many of our SME customers, and it helped them greatly reduce the production environment monitoring complexity.</p>



<p>Big Data can also be applied in Industry 4.0, where edge computing and trained ML models help operate autonomous factories and facilities; in agriculture, where normalization of the data on cattle diseases and treatments for them allows the farmers to identify the illnesses and apply the correct medications faster, without the need to wait for the vet; in marketing, where a trained AI algorithm can analyze a huge influx of news data and filter out only niche-relevant for the domain owner, like showing the latest news on eLearning on an educational portal — and much, much more.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts on in-depth DevOps features</h2>



<p>Even standard DevOps transformation would be very beneficial for your business. Should you decide to go for a deeper dive into advanced DevOps capabilities, and implement Big Data analytics — you would reap much more advantages and cut your expenses even more. The only challenge on this way is finding a reliable IT services partner, who will be able to provide an end-to-end solution for your project.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>While people often discuss AI, they can rarely describe how some algorithm works or what it can be used for. We provide a brief summary and use cases for Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Deep Learning</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/demystified-ai-machine-learning-deep-learning/">Demystified: AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people regard the terms Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) as synonyms. This is actually quite far from the truth, and today we demystify these misconceptions.</p>
<p><span id="more-4819"></span></p>
<p>AI, ML, and DL are the practical applications of various data analysis models and algorithms for various <span id="cases">use cases</span> in different industries. While these tools cannot yet make moral choices or act as sentient machines, they hold the potential to drive more value for any business. This is done by finding previously unseen patterns and predicting the possible outcomes of certain actions. We hope this article will provide a better understanding of the AI, ML and DL capabilities, and will become your starting point in a journey towards AI-powered data analytics.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4828" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_industries.png" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL use cases" width="1200" height="421" /> The first step along this way was done through <span id="expert">expert</span> systems, which were the first attempt to codify the processes of the data analysis. Experts explained the rules of some domain expertise, these were later codified in rules engines and used to answer the questions. However, this structure was able to work only according to these predefined rules and could not improve over time. Keeping the rules engines up-to-date as new facts are added is also a cumbersome and effort-consuming endeavor. However, expert systems are still quite widespread in healthcare and finances.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4832 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_expert_systems.png" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL expert systems" width="1000" height="421" /> The next step towards machine learning was made when the modern computer CPU architecture was introduced, followed by Graphic Processor Units (<span id="GPUs">GPUs</span>). The core benefit of GPUs is that they enable parallel data processing due to housing thousands of smaller cores, as opposed to serial processing in several larger cores of CPUs. The further evolution of this technology and <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-becomes-synonym-cloud-computing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">transition to the cloud</a> of all data-intensive projects had lead to a significant boom in AI development.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4826 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_tech.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL technology" width="663" height="421" /> In addition, using the <a href="https://itsvit.com/big-data/2017-review-big-data-projects-tools/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span id="big data">Big Data</span> tools</a> like Hadoop, Spark, Flink, Map Reduce and <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-5-reasons-use-apache-cassandra-database/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cassandra</a> ensures the businesses leverage their Big Data capabilities to the max. Previously, the data was stored somewhere and had to be uploaded elsewhere to be processed. This caused the data transfer speed to be the bottleneck and was quite expensive. The modern-day approach means storing the data in the cloud and directing the processing to the data, not the other way around. This is much more cost-effective, not to mention being much faster.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4825" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_system-structure.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL system structure" width="1200" height="675" /></p>
<h2><span id="ai">What is AI</span>: something great that doesn’t work just yet</h2>
<p>We have already published an article explaining that <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-coming-not-sentient-robots/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AI is not coming in form of sentient robots</a>. As a matter of fact, AI has been an umbrella term and buzzword ever since the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Turing test</a>. Scientists were striving to create the intellect in the machine, but this should not have been a copy of human intellect.</p>
<p><b>AI is a set of algorithms that learn and evolve over time, becoming better and better in dealing with their task, but are incapable of moral choices (don’t know what is good or bad) or understanding the value of art, or receiving an aesthetic pleasure from music.</b></p>
<p>Actually, AI is now more of a codename for a new frontier in the minds of men. Every new aspect of mathematical theory gains its practical implementation and stops being an AI. This phenomenon was described by Ted Dunning, Ph.D., Chief Application Architect at MapR (enterprise Hadoop vendor), who said that “<b>when something does not work &#8211; we call it AI. When it begins to work right — we call it something else</b>.”</p>
<h2><span id="ml">What is Machine Learning</span>: AI applied to Big Data Analytics</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is the subset of AI technology that boomed around 1980s. Its main application is the ever-increasing quality and precision of big data analysis. The ML algorithms find patterns in the historical data and the trained ML models follow these patterns to predict the valuable insights in new data.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4823 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_logic.png" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL logic" width="1027" height="500" /></p>
<p>There are two main subdomains of the ML learning domain: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Supervised learning</b> uses data labels (both the income and the output data are provided to the algorithm) created by humans to structure the data. The ML models in this category include random decision forests, naive Bayes algorithms, SVM, and linear or logistic regression training.</li>
<li><b>Unsupervised learning</b> uses unlabeled data and the ML models have to either train themselves at their own pace or apply the reinforced learning technique, which maximizes the rewards depending on feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Machine Learning is mostly leveraged for data classification and is widely used in the financial and banking industries to fight fraud and for risk management. We have described the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/5-use-cases-machine-learning-banking-industry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">use cases of machine learning in the banking industry</a> or how various businesses are <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-5-machine-learning-use-cases-financial-industry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">using machine learning to improve financial services</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="dl">Deep Learning</span>: multiple layers of neural networks</h2>
<p>Deep Learning algorithms use multiple layers of nodes with different weights, so-called Deep Neural Networks or DNNs. There are input and output nodes, and at least 10 layers between them. By adjusting the logical weight of each DNN node, the data scientists can influence the outcome, thus training the model to reach the required results at scale. Due to the development of massively parallel processing of data and the use of potent GPUs, data scientists can nowadays use the DNNs with thousands of layers.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4829" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_DNN.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL DNN example" width="1200" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Every readjustment of the logical weight results in the model better understanding the required object features. The advantage of this process is that the features can be not defined in the beginning, and the model will learn to identify the best outcome on its own with time.</p>
<p>DNNs are the most widespread but not the only types of ML algorithms used in Deep Learning.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4827 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_types.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL types" width="785" height="344" /></p>
<p>We have explained <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/short-guide-deep-learning-really-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how Deep Learning really works</a>, as well as covering multiple Deep Learning advancements made in 2017 in the areas like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">text and speech applications</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">machine perception and OCR</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/big-data/deep-learning-summary-2017-reinforced-learning-miscellaneous-apps/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reinforced learning and robotic movement apps</a>. These applications disrupt and improve the healthcare, financial and retail industries, as well as many other areas of life.</p>
<h2><span id="future">Prospects</span> of AI technology evolution</h2>
<p>Thus said, there were significant improvements in the effectiveness of AI applications over the last decade. Even though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov</a> more than 20 years ago, the next sound victory of this type happened only recently, when Google DeepMind’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AlphaGo won vs the active Go champion Lee Sedol</a> in 2016. This does not mean the AI development has stalled — quite contrary, it boomed significantly.</p>

Certain similarities between the natural and artificial intelligence still remain, like in <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/loihi-self-learning-chip-intel/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Loihi, the self-learning chip from Intel</a>. However, recent technological advancements underpin the potent trend of employing ML algorithms for large-scale data analysis.</p>
<h2><span id="conclusions">Final thoughts</span> on AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>
<p>Is <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/future-ai-deep-learning-much/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Learning the direction the AI will evolve</a>? We think not, as there are new exciting applications constantly appearing on the cutting edge of technology, as well as the new possibilities to apply ML and DL in previously not digitalized industries. As more and more businesses complete their cloud transition, more and more prospects for leveraging the AI algorithms in Big Data analytics offer themselves.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-summit-2018-london-highlights-takeaways/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS 2018 Summit in London</a>, Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels revealed that AWS concentrates their effort in delivering AI-powered features and services for their product to further empower the value delivery for their customers. This resulted in multiple AI/ML/DL releases, announcements and features presented during the recent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/aws/aws-previews-and-pre-announcements-at-reinvent-2018-andy-jassy-keynote/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS </a>re:Invent 2018 week.</p>
<p>Microsoft does the same, housing an 8,000-people-strong R&amp;D department wholly dedicated to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/one-year-later-microsoft-ai-research-grows-8k-people-massive-bet-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">developing AI and ML services for Azure</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>We are living in the computer era, and the words like Machine Learning and AI are interwoven neatly with our lives. However, while science fiction and movie industry depict sentient robots, the real-life AI applications are anything but. This is why AI is coming into our lives, and why it will not be about sentient vacuum cleaners and robo-maids.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-coming-not-sentient-robots/">AI is coming, and it is not about sentient robots</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The whole generations worldwide grew reading Isaac Asimov’s books and watching the movies like Terminator, The Matrix an I, Robot. They dream of AI, but that AI is not to come… at least for now.<br />
<span id="more-3297"></span> Alan Turing, the English mathematician and the inventor of computers has formulated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Turing test</a> to determine the presence of a true Artificial Intelligence:</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 10px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;"><p><em><b>“If a computer can exhibit an intelligent behavior that cannot be distinguished from that of a human (do well in an imitation game, for example) — that computer can be considered sentient.”</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Since its inception in 1950-s, this definition of AI has caused innumerable data science and machine learning specialists worldwide to try to pursue something like an “anthropomorphic computing” — a machine capable of reasoning and of making spontaneous volitive acts. However, despite recent mentions of some examples of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27762088" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">successful Turing test attempts</a>, the direction the AI development industry is currently moving is far from creating sentient robots.</p>
<h2 id="infancy">AI is still in its infancy</h2>
<p>Despite being around for more than half a century, the AI theory was able to receive adequate technological grounding only recently, with the introduction of multicore processors, multi-gigabyte RAM, SSDs and other features of cloud computing. It is only natural that all major cloud providers are actively developing their AI-based services and specific offerings (including serverless computing and ML-optimized hardware like that <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/loihi-self-learning-chip-intel/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">self-learning Loihi chip from Intel</a>).<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3303" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AI-is-coming-ITSvit-1.jpg" alt="AI is coming, and it is not about sentient robots 1" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
As a result, we are barely witnessing the infancy of the AI technology. Airplanes and cars appeared little more than a century ago — yet they changed the world we live in dramatically. We expect AI to do the same, and at a much faster pace. But fear not the Skynet, as instead of creating sentient robots, AI and ML developers went for cloud-based reinforced learning apps.</p>
<h2 id="droids">These are not the droids you are looking for</h2>
<p>AI algorithms and Machine Learning (ML) models are nowadays used mostly to automate routine human work on IMPROVEMENT of some aspects of the business. Please note, we are not talking about automation of some mechanical process, like the car conveyer operations. Industrial robots have been around for quite a while, and these are old news. We talk of delegating the tasks of aggregating, processing, and comprehending vast volumes of various human-generated data.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3304" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AI-is-coming-ITSvit-2.jpg" alt="AI is coming, and it is not about sentient robots 2" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>The tasks like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">text and speech recognition</a>, natural language processing and generation, music creation, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-machine-perception-developments/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">optical image recognition</a>, or even <a href="https://itsvit.com/big-data/deep-learning-summary-2017-reinforced-learning-miscellaneous-apps/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Atlas robot movement algorithms</a> — these tasks belong to the Deep Learning branch of the Machine learning tree in a wider AI forest. Even the widely-discussed voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, Cortana and others — these are not sentient programs residing in the smart speaker systems. These are merely the algorithms written by a community of developers (and Amazon actually pays well for <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/alexa-apps-dive-move-along-wait-now/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">making new Alexa skills</a>).</p>
<p>AI and ML tools developed and used today can do many things better, faster, more precisely, predicting the outcomes based on some historical data, etc. What they cannot do is shutting down your computer or locking the house entrance against your will.</p>
<h2 id="apps">AI applications in business today</h2>
<p>We list 4 business applications of AI, though there are much more:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lightweight AI solutions</b>. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/bp-invests-20m-into-ai-startup-beyond-limits-born-in-nasas-caltech-labs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Beyond Limits</a>, a Silicon Valley startup leverages the technology used by NASA for training their computers for unmanned Mars missions. When adopted for healthcare, logistics, pharmaceutical and other industries, these apps provide the cognitive power comparable to the experience of an industry veteran. This power can be used for solving complex business tasks without the need for massive underlying infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Big Intelligence</b>. A combination of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, these solutions are honed for processing vast chunks of data real-time, using the power of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/the-monolith-microservices-and-serverless-computing-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">serverless computing</a> and high-performance computing to provide a wealth of important business insights at your fingertips.</li>
<li><b>Timing optimization</b>. When the business provides services on a seasonal (tourism) or daily/weekly basis (catering, delivery, logistics), providing optimal resources at each point of time is crucial for sustainability. Hurricanes can ruin the season in some coastal city, so the tourists should be diverted to other locations, or a wedding boom might turn the catering companies shorthanded and in demand of more workforce for a couple of weeks. By deploying affordable analytical AI such businesses can meet the increased demand for resources, or cut on unneeded waste.</li>
<li><b>Cost-efficient lead generation</b>. Acquiring new customers means extensive (and expensive) cold calls and marketing campaigns for many businesses. By deploying a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/austin-ai-tech-startup-sugar-bot-looking-to-disrupt_us_59a82593e4b02498834a8f34" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tag analysis system like Sugarbot</a>, a business can augment their lead generation greatly. As the human agent makes relevant choices, the AI algorithm records the tags and learns. It then becomes able to process vast quantities of data and use the tag worlds to find relevant information within minutes, not weeks and months.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3305" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AI-is-coming-ITSvit-3.jpg" alt="AI is coming, and it is not about sentient robots 3" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<h2 id="final">Final thoughts on the state of AI industry nowadays</h2>
<p>To put it short, it is highly unlikely we develop Skynet or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot_(film)#Plot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">VIKI</a> — it is simply not feasible! Deploying AI algorithms brings fruit when they can be more efficient than humans at some tedious analytical, comparative or aggregatory activity. It is likely to stay that way in the future.</p>
<p>Do you think otherwise? Do you have some points to add or know of a tremendous AI business use case? We’d be glad to hear your story!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-coming-not-sentient-robots/">AI is coming, and it is not about sentient robots</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>While 2018 is still young, it can be immensely beneficial to know what is trending in the top tech industry fields like the cloud solutions, Big Data, AI, ML, IoT and other… We created a (relatively) short list of the most prominent trends and projects worth following in 2018.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/cutting-edge-trends-2018-cloud-big-data-ai-ml-iot/">Cutting-edge IT trends for 2018: Cloud, Big Data, AI, ML and IoT</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2018 might well become the year of huge leaps in predictive analytics, AI, edge computing, data storage, hybrid cloud and much more… Learn about the hottest IT trends for 2018!<br />
<span id="more-3093"></span>2017 was the year the IT industry matured and expanded beyond any previous limits, as the cloud service providers like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/new-aws-tech-introduced-aws-reinvent-2017/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS introduced the next generation of cloud instances</a>, data storage, and processing solutions, more potent and cost-efficient. While some Big Data tools and ML technologies became obsolete and had to be dropped, new, more feature-rich and productive tooling (like Spark) comes to their place.<br />
The term Big Data itself is somewhat excessive right now, as we know the data in question is huge by default. This is why many IT experts and credible sources largely use just “data” instead. As using the data analytics efficiently is crucial for successful business decision-making, the whole pack of IT industry branches is centered around high-velocity data aggregation, inexpensive data storage, high-speed data processing and high-accuracy data analytics. Let’s take a closer look at the cutting-edge tech trends for the businesses in 2018.</p>
<h2>IoT for high-velocity data aggregation</h2>
<p>Data lakes used for Big Data analytics have multiple inlets, like social media, internal data flows from CRM/ERP systems, accounting platforms, etc. Nonetheless, when we add IoT sensors to the mix the complexity grows tenfold. In order to be able to extract valuable insights from this data, it must be aggregated and processed quickly and the amount of data inserted should be kept at the lowest level appropriate.</p>
<p>For example, when collecting the Industry 4.0 data from fully-automated factories, there might be hundreds of temperature sensors scattered across the facility, which will be transmitting the same temperature data in normal mode. In this case, it is logical to cut off 99% of data and report only that the temperature was nominal. Only if (when) the temperature spike happens, should the edge-computing system react, locate the sensor that raised the alert, analyze the situation and act appropriately.</p>
<p>As another example, let’s assume we have a wind power plant with multiple wind turbines rotating under the edge computing system control. If the wind blast brings small gravel that can damage the rotor bearings, the first turbine hit reports of the impact, the system identifies the threat and responds by ordering the rest of the turbines to rotate their fans in a direction allowing to avoid a collision.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3097" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cutting-edge-IT-trends-for-2018-edge-computing.jpg" alt="Cutting-edge IT trends for 2018 - Cloud, Big Data, AI, ML and IoT_1" width="1200" height="628" />Such high-velocity data aggregation and analysis with edge computing systems are already available on many cloud platforms, and will further expand in 2018.</p>
<h2>Inexpensive data storage in the cloud</h2>
<p>Cloud storage is a must for data lakes, as only leveraging the cloud computing resources allows unleashing the full potential of business intelligence and Big Data analytics systems. However, when the data in question is huge, so will be the expenses on its storage. While many cloud service providers like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/news/aws-vs-gcp-cloud-service-provider-choose/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS or GCP</a> work hard on minimizing the data storage expenses, they still remain substantial. The questions of data security also raise certain concerns, as multiple departments gain access to the cloud and strict security protocols should be applied to ensure the safety of data at work.</p>

<p>One possible solution is going for hybrid cloud strategy and combining the granular access right provided by on-prem infrastructure with immense and easily-scalable computational power of the public cloud. The other approach lies within using <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/blockchain-big-data-match-made-heavens/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain-powered cloud storage</a> options, as some pilots proved to provide <b>90% cost reduction as compared to AWS</b>.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3096" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cutting-edge-IT-trends-for-2018-data-storage.jpg" alt="Cutting-edge IT trends for 2018 - Cloud, Big Data, AI, ML and IoT_3" width="1200" height="628" />In 2018 these projects will thrive and mature, readying for an industry-wide adoption.</p>
<h2>High-speed Big Data processing</h2>
<p>The Big Data solutions provider Syncsort has published a survey of the Big Data challenges and issues faced by the enterprise businesses. One of the key findings of that survey is the fact nearly <b>70% of respondents mentioned the implications with ETL</b>, meaning they struggle to process the incoming data fast enough to keep their data lakes fresh and relevant.</p>
<p>Real-time and predictive analytics that are required to provide solid ground for on-point business analytics demand polished data processing workflows, while over <b>75%</b> of the Syncsort survey respondents acknowledged they <b>need to be able to process data more rapidly</b>. <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/big-data-visualization-principles/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Big Data visualization models</a> allow providing the analytics results in a clearly comprehensible form.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3095" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cutting-edge-IT-trends-for-2018-data-processing.jpg" alt="Cutting-edge IT trends for 2018 - Cloud, Big Data, AI, ML and IoT_2" width="1200" height="628" />2018 is likely to be the year various <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-4-popular-big-data-visualization-tools/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Big Data visualization tools</a> become even more production-ready and able to cater to the needs of enterprise business.</p>
<h2>AI and ML used for high-accuracy data analytics</h2>
<p>The main direction AI and Machine Learning (ML) development is taking today is the improvement of the ways the humans interact with computers by writing special algorithms. These algorithms allow to automate the routine work or improve the results of the tasks where the outcomes are traditionally highly dependent on human skills. 2017 saw great accomplishments in the ML areas like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">text translation</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-machine-perception-developments/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">optical image recognition</a>, and various other projects.</p>
<p><b>See also</b>: <a href="https://itsvit.com/big-data/deep-learning-summary-2017-reinforced-learning-miscellaneous-apps/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Learning summary for 2017: Reinforced Learning and Miscellaneous apps</a></p>
<p>Amazon’s prediction engine is intended to provide better service to the customers, yet as of now, its accuracy is quite low, around 10% at best. In the end of 2017, AWS joined forces with Azure to develop a new-generation AI platform, <a href="https://github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gluon API</a>. By outsourcing the platform AWS and Azure hope to encourage AI developers of any skill level to produce more clean and efficient AI algorithms.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3098" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cutting-edge-IT-trends-for-2018-Gluon-API.jpg" alt="Cutting-edge IT trends for 2018 - Cloud, Big Data, AI, ML and IoT_4" width="1200" height="628" />We are sure Gluon will be heartily welcomed in 2018 and will become one of the main tools in any AI developer’s toolkit.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on the cutting-edge IT trends for 2018</h2>
<p>2018 will definitely be the year multiple cloud, Big Data, IoT and AI/ML projects enter the production-grade phase. Tools like Spark, JupyteR, Gluon and others will find their way to the hearts and toolkits of the enterprise specialists. People responsible for the digital transformation and increased efficiency of Business Intelligence &amp; Big Data analytics in their companies must keep a close eye on these trends and adopt the solutions once they are ready.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let this fact carve into your mind: <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/28/amazon-closes-whole-foods-acquisition-heres-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon has acquired Whole Foods</a> and less than in a month they sliced the prices for literally every item in the inventory — and still met the margins threshold!<br />
<span id="more-1743"></span></p>
<p>How did they do it? Through better logistics and inventory allocation, which means selling the excess stocks of goods or moving them from areas with low consumer activity to the areas with higher activity to meet the demand. To put it short: using the Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize the business flow. Walmart and Alibaba do the same and if YOU don’t, well… bad news for you.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1746" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AI_Is_The_Way_To_Do_Business_ITSvit_3.jpg" alt="AI_Is_The_Way_To_Do_Business_ITSvit_3" width="890" height="352" /></p>
<p>We recently explained <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/moving-infrastructure-cloud-5-not-obvious-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">why any business should consider the transition to the cloud</a>, along with pointing out the benefits of approaching the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-becomes-synonym-cloud-computing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AI as a natural component of the cloud computing</a> service from the provider of choice. However, there is much more to this. Not using the AI algorithms against the Big Data your business receives in advertising, marketing, customer support and many other fields would be simply wasteful. Here is why such approach is so beneficial.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingNews/Pages/end-retail-as-we-know-it-how-can-marketers-adapt.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">report from the American Marketing Association</a>, 2017 will see about $459 billion income from selling online and a whopping $3.6 trillion from brick-and-mortar retail. The former grows dynamically year by year, while the latter increases at a much steadier rate. Thus said, in some foreseeable future online sales will level with offline retail, and will later surpass them. This means forging an efficient unity of online and offline operations is a crucial component of surviving and dominating the market nowadays.</p>
<h2>AI-powered business</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1745" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AI_Is_The_Way_To_Do_Business_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="AI_Is_The_Way_To_Do_Business_ITSvit_2" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>When your business grows, the amount of data you operate can proliferate quickly. Customer and prospect details, logistics reports, online traffic demography and other statistics, ads clicks and social activity, employee engagement levels along with determination for self-improvement and professional growth — all of these components of the successful business are essential, but tracking and analyzing them in a conventional way is often impossible or not feasible.</p>
<p>A startup or SMB (small-to-medium business) might start using the cloud from the beginning, which eases the transition to AI-powered <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/10-hot-trends-big-data-analytics-2017/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Big Data analytics</a> when the company grows and the time comes. After this is done, the business can both cut their expenses and generate additional margins by utilizing top-notch technology.</p>
<p>On the other hand, every corporate business sooner or later acknowledges the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/digital-transformation-multi-cloud-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">digital transformation through adopting multi-cloud strategy</a> is inevitable. Thus said, incorporating Big Data analytics for monitoring and optimizing literally every aspect of business operations is a wise choice to do from the get-go. One of the best examples of this approach is the General Electric company, that transforms itself <a href="https://www.ge.com/digital/blog/waking-up-software-analytics-company-building-intelligence-machines-systems" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">aiming to become one of top 10 tech companies</a>. Following this approach, while requiring certain investments in the beginning, will definitely bring fruit in the long run, as Amazon, Walmart and Alibaba show us.</p>
<p>If you are afraid you are too late for the ride and Amazon is unbeatable — think of Google. When the company entered the search engine market, there were dozens of competitors — from multinational Yahoo! to national market players like Yandex and Rambler. The future was uncertain, but Google did exactly what was needed — they provided a fast and easy to use Chrome browser delivering the most relevant results, convenient interface for users and ample toolkit for advertisers. As a result, Google is clearly dominating the ever-growing IT-industry market nowadays.</p>
<p>The same can be said about any business. The company that will provide excellent services with minimal expenses and leverage their Big Data to the max by augmenting all relevant parts of business workflow with AI algorithms will prevail in their market niche.</p>
<p>Will it be your company?</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-way-business-now/">AI: the only way to do business from now on</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<span id="more-1732"></span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1734" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AI_Synonym_Cloud_Computing_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="AI_Synonym_Cloud_Computing_ITSvit_2" width="833" height="415" /></p>
<p>While many obstacles slow down the AI development in this direction, there already are many advances to be proud of.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/26/google-deepmind/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google’s acquisition of Deepmind</a> allowed the IT giant to drastically improve their efficiency with Translate, <a href="https://montfort.io/google-rank-brain-what-is-it-and-how-will-it-affect-seo/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rank Brain AI</a> is revolutionizing the SEO, and their <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/06/google-x-neural-network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">cat recognition experiment using Google Computer Vision API</a> empowered the company to open a new page in visual data analysis. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) neural networks can be trained to recognize any patterns in data and pinpoint any image parts, be it a car, a bed, a form and size of a cucumber, an alleged fraud attempt or any other case, whether it follows the rules or presents an anomaly.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/future-ai-deep-learning-much/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">deep learning is not exactly the AI</a>, as we have previously explained. The main flaws of DL algorithm are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can operate only within the borders of the dataset used for its training,</li>
<li>It cannot make morally correct choices,</li>
<li>It cannot provide the reasons for its decisions, it just gives the answers.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, the capability to discover patterns in unstructured data and representing them real-time provides a solid basis for grounded business decisions, precise resource allocation to cut costs and timely actions to earn profits. This is why all businesses want to harness the power of AI and they naturally go from building and maintaining their own expensive on-prem IT infrastructure to renting the immense computational power Google, Aws and MS Azure provide, as <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/IT-as-a-service-From-build-to-consume" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">McKinsey report</a> states.</p>
<h2>AI-powered cloud computing</h2>
<p>The true power of AI in its current stage of implementation comes only with HUGE volumes of data, as one of the Microsoft Machine Learning Team experiments <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2017/07/25/lessons-learned-benchmarking-fast-machine-learning-algorithms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">showed</a>. A seemingly bad algorithm, making dire mistakes analyzing a relatively small influx of data can actually show itself as a brilliant tool when used against massive data stores.</p>
<p>Cloud computing, providing access and tools to work with HUGE open data is an essential component of success. Google has used its massive data stores to train their AI and made the datasets of <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/introducing-open-images-dataset.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tagged photos</a> and <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/announcing-youtube-8m-large-and-diverse.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Youtube videos</a> freely accessible in an effort to bolster the AI development for all enthusiasts worldwide. This is why the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/moving-infrastructure-cloud-5-not-obvious-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">transition to the cloud</a> like Google Cloud, AWS or MS Azure is a step every business should rather do sooner, than later.</p>
<p>How can the businesses actually benefit from AI-powered cloud computing? Here are but a few possible use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chatbots for customer self-service portals</li>
<li>Chatbots with open APIs for various messengers</li>
<li>Picture analysis, image recognition</li>
<li><a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/10-hot-trends-big-data-analytics-2017/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Big Data analytics for decision-making</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is sure the future interaction between a human and a computer will go through conversation, not through programming. This opinion is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sundar-pichai-ai-first-world-2016-4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">supported</a> by Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who says “the future is more than mobile-first, it is the AI-first world”.</p>
<h2>The perspectives of AI-first cloud</h2>
<p>Mobile-first approach to application development introduced us to Snapchat, Uber and other great apps. Just imagine what services and features the AI-first world will offer? The possibilities are truly breathtaking! But will it be profitable? You’d bet it will! The <a href="http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/machine-learning-as-a-service-market.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">report</a> from Transparency International predicts the machine learning industry will grow from $1.07 billion profit in 2016 to approximately $17 billion by 2025. Don’t lose your chance to hop on the AI-powered train!</p>
<p>What do you think of this? Are you among 80% of decision-makers that plan to begin using the AI-powered cloud computing in their daily business routine, according to <a href="https://narrativescience.com/Resources/Resource-Library/Article-Detail-Page/Outlook-on-Artificial-Intelligence-in-the-Enterprise-2016" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Narrative Science survey</a>? Or are you still afraid of change? Remember, the Western Union was instated as a telegraph company, until they realized people needed sending money much more than sending telegrams…</p>
<p>They made the transition at the right moment. Will you?</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-becomes-synonym-cloud-computing/">AI becomes the synonym for cloud computing</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence or AI is no longer a term from the sci-fi novels and movies. It is a profitable industry, involving hundreds of high-tech startups and billions of dollars in investments worldwide.<br />
<span id="more-1723"></span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1725" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hot_AI_Technologies_ITSvit_3.jpg" alt="Hot_AI_Technologies_ITSvit_3" width="1000" height="418" /></p>
<p>The International Data Corporation report forecasts the AI industry income to surge  6 times in four years: from mere $8 billion in 2016 to more than $47 in 2020. In addition, the <a href="https://go.forrester.com/wp-content/uploads/Forrester_Predictions_2017_-Artificial_Intelligence_Will_Drive_The_Insights_Revolution.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Forrester report</a> states that 2017 will see 300% more investments into AI industry, as compared to 2016.</p>
<p>What drives such insatiable hunger? Why are IT industry heavyweights like Google, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft so eager to pour millions of dollars into startups that sometimes promise merely a blink of success?</p>
<p>Because we are leaving in the age of information overload. The flow of information is so dense that terabytes of it are generated worldwide every second and that 99% of it will never be read by a human being. To say even more, an average Millennial is able to concentrate on a task for no more than 15 minutes and loses focus on a text if not engaged <a href="http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">within the first 8 seconds</a>.</p>
<p>Thus said, curating the data according to a set of parameters in order to provide exactly the information the customer requests — this is the task AI should solve. This is the obvious evolution of currently popular neural networks. However, there are still some issues, as we have already explained in this article on <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/future-ai-deep-learning-much/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">why deep learning alone is not the true AI</a>.</p>
<p>There are other obstacles to adopting AI amongst enterprise businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>39% of respondents are still not sure how their business can benefit from using the AI</li>
<li>42% do not have any AI-based business case as of yet</li>
<li>29% have to invest into building or modernizing their Big Data management first</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">33% simply lack the skills needed to implement the AI in their business routine</li>
</ul>
<p>The company that will create a sentient AI algorithm able to communicate with any customer and provide exactly the information requested — this company will rule the IT industry world. This is why <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/08/03/microsoft-cloud-ai-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Microsoft states AI to be its top priority</a> from now on.</p>
<p>There are numerous other areas of employment for an AI, like monitoring work in hazardous environments and construction, along with 20 other industries (yes, we mean <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IBM Watson</a> here) like healthcare, financial services and insurance, retail and marketing. This is why knowing the current state of affairs in the AI field is essential. Below we list top 6 hot Ai technologies for 2017.</p>
<h2>Computer vision and image recognition algorithms</h2>
<p>From analyzing picture contents to find cats and all the way up to finding a particular person on a video through analysis of their posture, silhouette or movements, <b>computer vision</b> AI developers work on designing an algorithm that will be able to understand the contents of a video or a picture, or even react to a live video streaming input. Some of the most impressive applications include self-driving cars, smarter security cams, or even a <a href="http://www.intellectualventureslab.com/work/photonic-fence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">laser-firing system for zapping the malaria mosquitos</a>! This technology is of utmost importance and will definitely deliver more and more impressive results in the years to come!</p>
<h2>Recognition and understanding of verbal and written speech</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1727" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hot_AI_Technologies_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="Hot_AI_Technologies_ITSvit_2" width="1000" height="418" /></p>
<p>This trend has four major components: natural language processing (NLP) and generation (NLG), speech recognition and virtual interactive assistants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text analysis and <b>natural language processing</b> are an essential part of understanding the customer’s intent, not mere search requests. This is the foundation for providing personalized ads offers, finding relevant content for search requests and can even help recruiters find relevant applicants by analyzing their CV’s on the job boards, even if there is no full skill match.</li>
<li><b>Natural language generation</b> involves creating readable texts from computer data. This AI application is crucial for in-depth reports, chatbots on customer self-service portals, and for delivering point-of-need smart alerts on real-time analytics of data feeds.</li>
<li>From simple self-service portal chatbots and all the way up to self-learning <b>virtual assistants</b> like Alexa, Siri and Cortana, these AI systems are currently in the focus of attention from the media. As the Internet of Things becomes more of a reality and less of a gimmick, these systems will become more and more affordable and ubiquitous.</li>
<li><b>Speech recognition</b> is an important and integral part of the aforementioned virtual assistants. Voice commands are a huge field for improvement of a human-machine interaction. Just imagine freely speaking to your assistant, controlling home appliances, writing code, making notes, surfing the Youtube videos — and without being confined by the keyboard, only with your voice. This trend is really hot and will undoubtedly grow more important with time, as the IoT hits the market.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Platforms for machine learning</h2>
<p>IT industry giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft offer APIs, data sets, algorithms, development and training toolkits along with the required computing power for designing, training and deploying various machine learning models. These models are currently used across a plethora of enterprise applications, delivering various types of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/10-hot-trends-big-data-analytics-2017/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Big Data analytics</a> (predictive and prescriptive analytics, streaming analytics, unstructured data analytics, etc.)</p>
<h2>Deep learning</h2>
<p>These AI algorithms involve neural networks with multiple hidden abstract layers and are best used against huge data sets for classification and pattern (or anomaly) recognition. As of now, deep learning is an important part of AI development, statistical analysis and data processing, and this trend is not likely going to change.</p>
<h2>Biometrics</h2>
<p>AI is able to recognize the fingerprints, retina images, body postures, voice and speech patterns, etc. Such AI technologies are currently used in marketing and security applications, but in future, they will undoubtedly get more implementations. AI will make the comparison of facial 3D prints more accurate to drastically reduce the chance of falsifying the results of security scanning.</p>
<h2>Expert systems for decision-making assistance</h2>
<p>These methods include the addition of various rules and logic into AI engines. This helps build, train and maintain scalable applications, that are capable of automated <b>decision-making</b> for routine business processes, so the need for human intervention is minimal. One of the real-life applications of such <b>expert systems</b> is using them to diagnose mammary cancer. When the AI is able to evaluate the X-ray photograph and provide the result within seconds (while also self-learning along the way) this is beneficial both for the doctor, who can treat much more patients within the same time, and for the patients, who avoid the risk of false positive diagnosis, saving them nerves, time, money and health on expensive treatment.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>AI industry continues to conquer the enterprise market, and these 6 hot AI technologies for 2017 we described above will become more and more popular and important. As Narrative Science report states, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/07/20/artificial-intelligence-rapidly-adopted-by-enterprises-survey-says/#4d0c4ee612da" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">62% of enterprises will use some kind of AI technologies by 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Will your business be amongst them?</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/hot-ai-technologies-top-6-2017/">Hot AI Technologies: Top 6 for 2017</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>
