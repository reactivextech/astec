										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Augmenting the daily IT operations with Machine Learning is the next frontier, the next way to obtain and secure the competitive edge. Here is how we do it at IT Svit.</p>
<p><span id="more-5086"></span></p>
<p>As Dr. Werner Wogels, Amazon CTO has pointed out during <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-summit-2018-london-highlights-takeaways/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS Summit London 2018</a> last May, the <b>IaaS has largely matured nearly</b> <b>10 years ago</b>. AWS still works on improving their offers, yet there is no principal difference between M2 and M5 EC2 instances in terms of functionality. The same goes for the Google Cloud Platform and MS Azure — the playing field is quite level nowadays in terms of hardware, as <b>every business has equal access to the same level of IT infrastructure and cloud resources</b>.</p>
<p><b>“We matured our IaaS services way back in 2009/2010.” © Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO</b></p>
<p>During the same event, Dr. Woegels unveiled the new field of competition for the Cloud Service Providers and customers alike — implementing the Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Machine Learning (ML) algorithms across the board. As a matter of fact, MS Azure has 8,000 people in an R&amp;D department dedicated solely to developing and improving Azure AI services and products. This highlights the tremendous importance of AI and ML in modern DevOps strategies.</p>
<p>IT Svit has 2 main ways of combining DevOps and Machine Learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using DevOps best practices to design, implement and maintain the infrastructure required for training and operating the Machine Learning models, which are used in <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/cutting-edge-trends-2018-cloud-big-data-ai-ml-iot/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Big Data analytics</a> projects of our customers.</li>
<li>Using Machine Learning algorithms in our own AIOps processes to automate the mundane operations and automatically apply the solutions for the repetitive tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both approaches are equally important for IT Svit, so we describe them in some more details below.</p>
<h2>Using DevOps for Machine Learning</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5089" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ITSvit_DevOps_Machine_Learning_Frameworks_training.jpg" alt="How IT Svit uses DevOps for Machine Learning frameworks: training" width="1338" height="700" /></p>
<p>When a business wants to make use of the Big Data at their disposal to obtain useful business insights out of it, they need to implement a Big Data solution. This requires a certain infrastructure, that has to be designed, provisioned, configured and maintained. This infrastructure should include the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object storages for gathering differing data types,</li>
<li>Distributed databases like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-5-reasons-use-apache-cassandra-database/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cassandra</a>, MongoDB or Redis for storing the normalized information,</li>
<li>AI features from AWS. Azure or GCP to train the appropriate ML model</li>
<li>Monitoring, logging, alerting, and backup tools, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus said, these are quite common parts for any IT Svit project, so our <a href="https://itsvit.com/our-services/devops-service-provider/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dedicated DevOps team</a> is able to compose and set up the needed system shortly, as well as running it afterward.</p>
<h2>Using Machine Learning for DevOps</h2>
<p>The second side of the medal is using the Machine Learning algorithms to augment our daily operations and optimize the performance of the cloud infrastructures for our clients. We covered this in more detail in the recent article about <a href="https://itsvit.com/our-services/devops-service-provider/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how IT Svit uses AIOps</a> in our projects. In short, our bespoke ML solution gathers the data on all the incidents and the solutions that were applied to them.</p>
<p>This way, in due time the admins will have to only approve the suggestions made by the system (like launching additional instances to deal with a sudden workload spike, etc.) Once the <b>accuracy of predictions grows above 95%</b>, we will allow the system to operate autonomously, thus enabling truly <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/create-self-healing-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">self-healing infrastructures for our clients</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5087" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ITSvit_DevOps_Machine_Learning_Frameworks_analytics.jpg" alt="How IT Svit uses DevOps for Machine Learning frameworks: analytics" width="1338" height="700" /></p>
<h2>Final thoughts on using DevOps with Machine Learning frameworks</h2>
<p>To sum it up, Machine Learning has matured and is now production-ready. Applying it alongside DevOps enables in-depth monitoring and management of ongoing operations, thus helping the companies save significantly on infrastructure maintenance. The same works the other way, as using DevOps approaches ensures quick and reliable infrastructure provisioning and stable operations for Big Data solutions that use Machine Learning models.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>While people often discuss AI, they can rarely describe how some algorithm works or what it can be used for. We provide a brief summary and use cases for Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Deep Learning</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/demystified-ai-machine-learning-deep-learning/">Demystified: AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people regard the terms Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) as synonyms. This is actually quite far from the truth, and today we demystify these misconceptions.</p>
<p><span id="more-4819"></span></p>
<p>AI, ML, and DL are the practical applications of various data analysis models and algorithms for various <span id="cases">use cases</span> in different industries. While these tools cannot yet make moral choices or act as sentient machines, they hold the potential to drive more value for any business. This is done by finding previously unseen patterns and predicting the possible outcomes of certain actions. We hope this article will provide a better understanding of the AI, ML and DL capabilities, and will become your starting point in a journey towards AI-powered data analytics.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4828" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_industries.png" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL use cases" width="1200" height="421" /> The first step along this way was done through <span id="expert">expert</span> systems, which were the first attempt to codify the processes of the data analysis. Experts explained the rules of some domain expertise, these were later codified in rules engines and used to answer the questions. However, this structure was able to work only according to these predefined rules and could not improve over time. Keeping the rules engines up-to-date as new facts are added is also a cumbersome and effort-consuming endeavor. However, expert systems are still quite widespread in healthcare and finances.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4832 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_expert_systems.png" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL expert systems" width="1000" height="421" /> The next step towards machine learning was made when the modern computer CPU architecture was introduced, followed by Graphic Processor Units (<span id="GPUs">GPUs</span>). The core benefit of GPUs is that they enable parallel data processing due to housing thousands of smaller cores, as opposed to serial processing in several larger cores of CPUs. The further evolution of this technology and <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-becomes-synonym-cloud-computing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">transition to the cloud</a> of all data-intensive projects had lead to a significant boom in AI development.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4826 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_tech.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL technology" width="663" height="421" /> In addition, using the <a href="https://itsvit.com/big-data/2017-review-big-data-projects-tools/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span id="big data">Big Data</span> tools</a> like Hadoop, Spark, Flink, Map Reduce and <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-5-reasons-use-apache-cassandra-database/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cassandra</a> ensures the businesses leverage their Big Data capabilities to the max. Previously, the data was stored somewhere and had to be uploaded elsewhere to be processed. This caused the data transfer speed to be the bottleneck and was quite expensive. The modern-day approach means storing the data in the cloud and directing the processing to the data, not the other way around. This is much more cost-effective, not to mention being much faster.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4825" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_system-structure.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL system structure" width="1200" height="675" /></p>
<h2><span id="ai">What is AI</span>: something great that doesn’t work just yet</h2>
<p>We have already published an article explaining that <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ai-coming-not-sentient-robots/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AI is not coming in form of sentient robots</a>. As a matter of fact, AI has been an umbrella term and buzzword ever since the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Turing test</a>. Scientists were striving to create the intellect in the machine, but this should not have been a copy of human intellect.</p>
<p><b>AI is a set of algorithms that learn and evolve over time, becoming better and better in dealing with their task, but are incapable of moral choices (don’t know what is good or bad) or understanding the value of art, or receiving an aesthetic pleasure from music.</b></p>
<p>Actually, AI is now more of a codename for a new frontier in the minds of men. Every new aspect of mathematical theory gains its practical implementation and stops being an AI. This phenomenon was described by Ted Dunning, Ph.D., Chief Application Architect at MapR (enterprise Hadoop vendor), who said that “<b>when something does not work &#8211; we call it AI. When it begins to work right — we call it something else</b>.”</p>
<h2><span id="ml">What is Machine Learning</span>: AI applied to Big Data Analytics</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is the subset of AI technology that boomed around 1980s. Its main application is the ever-increasing quality and precision of big data analysis. The ML algorithms find patterns in the historical data and the trained ML models follow these patterns to predict the valuable insights in new data.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4823 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_logic.png" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL logic" width="1027" height="500" /></p>
<p>There are two main subdomains of the ML learning domain: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Supervised learning</b> uses data labels (both the income and the output data are provided to the algorithm) created by humans to structure the data. The ML models in this category include random decision forests, naive Bayes algorithms, SVM, and linear or logistic regression training.</li>
<li><b>Unsupervised learning</b> uses unlabeled data and the ML models have to either train themselves at their own pace or apply the reinforced learning technique, which maximizes the rewards depending on feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Machine Learning is mostly leveraged for data classification and is widely used in the financial and banking industries to fight fraud and for risk management. We have described the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/5-use-cases-machine-learning-banking-industry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">use cases of machine learning in the banking industry</a> or how various businesses are <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-5-machine-learning-use-cases-financial-industry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">using machine learning to improve financial services</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="dl">Deep Learning</span>: multiple layers of neural networks</h2>
<p>Deep Learning algorithms use multiple layers of nodes with different weights, so-called Deep Neural Networks or DNNs. There are input and output nodes, and at least 10 layers between them. By adjusting the logical weight of each DNN node, the data scientists can influence the outcome, thus training the model to reach the required results at scale. Due to the development of massively parallel processing of data and the use of potent GPUs, data scientists can nowadays use the DNNs with thousands of layers.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4829" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_DNN.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL DNN example" width="1200" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Every readjustment of the logical weight results in the model better understanding the required object features. The advantage of this process is that the features can be not defined in the beginning, and the model will learn to identify the best outcome on its own with time.</p>
<p>DNNs are the most widespread but not the only types of ML algorithms used in Deep Learning.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4827 aligncenter" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_types.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL types" width="785" height="344" /></p>
<p>We have explained <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/short-guide-deep-learning-really-works/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how Deep Learning really works</a>, as well as covering multiple Deep Learning advancements made in 2017 in the areas like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">text and speech applications</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">machine perception and OCR</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/big-data/deep-learning-summary-2017-reinforced-learning-miscellaneous-apps/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reinforced learning and robotic movement apps</a>. These applications disrupt and improve the healthcare, financial and retail industries, as well as many other areas of life.</p>
<h2><span id="future">Prospects</span> of AI technology evolution</h2>
<p>Thus said, there were significant improvements in the effectiveness of AI applications over the last decade. Even though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov</a> more than 20 years ago, the next sound victory of this type happened only recently, when Google DeepMind’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AlphaGo won vs the active Go champion Lee Sedol</a> in 2016. This does not mean the AI development has stalled — quite contrary, it boomed significantly.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4885" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ITSvit_Demystified_AI_ML_DL_evolution.jpg" alt="IT Svit Demystified: AI, ML, DL evolution" width="1200" height="589" /><span id="from">From</span> sci-fi excitement of the early 1950s and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Dreams" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dreams of sentient robots</a>, we came to realize that AI is best used to automate laborious and time-consuming tasks at scale, not to imitate the functions of the human brain. Certain similarities between the natural and artificial intelligence still remain, like in <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/loihi-self-learning-chip-intel/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Loihi, the self-learning chip from Intel</a>. However, recent technological advancements underpin the potent trend of employing ML algorithms for large-scale data analysis.</p>
<h2><span id="conclusions">Final thoughts</span> on AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>
<p>Is <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/future-ai-deep-learning-much/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Learning the direction the AI will evolve</a>? We think not, as there are new exciting applications constantly appearing on the cutting edge of technology, as well as the new possibilities to apply ML and DL in previously not digitalized industries. As more and more businesses complete their cloud transition, more and more prospects for leveraging the AI algorithms in Big Data analytics offer themselves.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-summit-2018-london-highlights-takeaways/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS 2018 Summit in London</a>, Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels revealed that AWS concentrates their effort in delivering AI-powered features and services for their product to further empower the value delivery for their customers. This resulted in multiple AI/ML/DL releases, announcements and features presented during the recent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/aws/aws-previews-and-pre-announcements-at-reinvent-2018-andy-jassy-keynote/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS </a>re:Invent 2018 week.</p>
<p>Microsoft does the same, housing an 8,000-people-strong R&amp;D department wholly dedicated to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/one-year-later-microsoft-ai-research-grows-8k-people-massive-bet-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">developing AI and ML services for Azure</a>. AI is definitely hotter than ever nowadays and will become ever more profitable and useful in future.</p>
<p>Did you implement the ML models to your data analytics systems already? Would you like to do it? If so — <a href="https://itsvit.com/our-services/big-data-and-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IT Svit can help</a>!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/demystified-ai-machine-learning-deep-learning/">Demystified: AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>While 2018 is still young, it can be immensely beneficial to know what is trending in the top tech industry fields like the cloud solutions, Big Data, AI, ML, IoT and other… We created a (relatively) short list of the most prominent trends and projects worth following in 2018.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/cutting-edge-trends-2018-cloud-big-data-ai-ml-iot/">Cutting-edge IT trends for 2018: Cloud, Big Data, AI, ML and IoT</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2018 might well become the year of huge leaps in predictive analytics, AI, edge computing, data storage, hybrid cloud and much more… Learn about the hottest IT trends for 2018!<br />
<span id="more-3093"></span>2017 was the year the IT industry matured and expanded beyond any previous limits, as the cloud service providers like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/new-aws-tech-introduced-aws-reinvent-2017/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS introduced the next generation of cloud instances</a>, data storage, and processing solutions, more potent and cost-efficient. While some Big Data tools and ML technologies became obsolete and had to be dropped, new, more feature-rich and productive tooling (like Spark) comes to their place.<br />
The term Big Data itself is somewhat excessive right now, as we know the data in question is huge by default. This is why many IT experts and credible sources largely use just “data” instead. As using the data analytics efficiently is crucial for successful business decision-making, the whole pack of IT industry branches is centered around high-velocity data aggregation, inexpensive data storage, high-speed data processing and high-accuracy data analytics. Let’s take a closer look at the cutting-edge tech trends for the businesses in 2018.</p>
<h2>IoT for high-velocity data aggregation</h2>
<p>Data lakes used for Big Data analytics have multiple inlets, like social media, internal data flows from CRM/ERP systems, accounting platforms, etc. Nonetheless, when we add IoT sensors to the mix the complexity grows tenfold. In order to be able to extract valuable insights from this data, it must be aggregated and processed quickly and the amount of data inserted should be kept at the lowest level appropriate.</p>
<p>For example, when collecting the Industry 4.0 data from fully-automated factories, there might be hundreds of temperature sensors scattered across the facility, which will be transmitting the same temperature data in normal mode. In this case, it is logical to cut off 99% of data and report only that the temperature was nominal. Only if (when) the temperature spike happens, should the edge-computing system react, locate the sensor that raised the alert, analyze the situation and act appropriately.</p>
<p>As another example, let’s assume we have a wind power plant with multiple wind turbines rotating under the edge computing system control. If the wind blast brings small gravel that can damage the rotor bearings, the first turbine hit reports of the impact, the system identifies the threat and responds by ordering the rest of the turbines to rotate their fans in a direction allowing to avoid a collision.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3097" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cutting-edge-IT-trends-for-2018-edge-computing.jpg" alt="Cutting-edge IT trends for 2018 - Cloud, Big Data, AI, ML and IoT_1" width="1200" height="628" />Such high-velocity data aggregation and analysis with edge computing systems are already available on many cloud platforms, and will further expand in 2018.</p>
<h2>Inexpensive data storage in the cloud</h2>
<p>Cloud storage is a must for data lakes, as only leveraging the cloud computing resources allows unleashing the full potential of business intelligence and Big Data analytics systems. However, when the data in question is huge, so will be the expenses on its storage. While many cloud service providers like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/news/aws-vs-gcp-cloud-service-provider-choose/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS or GCP</a> work hard on minimizing the data storage expenses, they still remain substantial. The questions of data security also raise certain concerns, as multiple departments gain access to the cloud and strict security protocols should be applied to ensure the safety of data at work.</p>

<p>One possible solution is going for hybrid cloud strategy and combining the granular access right provided by on-prem infrastructure with immense and easily-scalable computational power of the public cloud. The other approach lies within using <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/blockchain-big-data-match-made-heavens/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain-powered cloud storage</a> options, as some pilots proved to provide <b>90% cost reduction as compared to AWS</b>.</p>

<h2>High-speed Big Data processing</h2>
<p>The Big Data solutions provider Syncsort has published a survey of the Big Data challenges and issues faced by the enterprise businesses. One of the key findings of that survey is the fact nearly <b>70% of respondents mentioned the implications with ETL</b>, meaning they struggle to process the incoming data fast enough to keep their data lakes fresh and relevant.</p>
<p>Real-time and predictive analytics that are required to provide solid ground for on-point business analytics demand polished data processing workflows, while over <b>75%</b> of the Syncsort survey respondents acknowledged they <b>need to be able to process data more rapidly</b>. <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/big-data-visualization-principles/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Big Data visualization models</a> allow providing the analytics results in a clearly comprehensible form.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3095" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cutting-edge-IT-trends-for-2018-data-processing.jpg" alt="Cutting-edge IT trends for 2018 - Cloud, Big Data, AI, ML and IoT_2" width="1200" height="628" />2018 is likely to be the year various <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-4-popular-big-data-visualization-tools/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Big Data visualization tools</a> become even more production-ready and able to cater to the needs of enterprise business.</p>
<h2>AI and ML used for high-accuracy data analytics</h2>
<p>The main direction AI and Machine Learning (ML) development is taking today is the improvement of the ways the humans interact with computers by writing special algorithms. These algorithms allow to automate the routine work or improve the results of the tasks where the outcomes are traditionally highly dependent on human skills. 2017 saw great accomplishments in the ML areas like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-text-speech-applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">text translation</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/deep-learning-summary-2017-machine-perception-developments/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">optical image recognition</a>, and various other projects.</p>
<p><b>See also</b>: <a href="https://itsvit.com/big-data/deep-learning-summary-2017-reinforced-learning-miscellaneous-apps/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Learning summary for 2017: Reinforced Learning and Miscellaneous apps</a></p>
<p>Amazon’s prediction engine is intended to provide better service to the customers, yet as of now, its accuracy is quite low, around 10% at best. In the end of 2017, AWS joined forces with Azure to develop a new-generation AI platform, <a href="https://github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gluon API</a>. By outsourcing the platform AWS and Azure hope to encourage AI developers of any skill level to produce more clean and efficient AI algorithms.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3098" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cutting-edge-IT-trends-for-2018-Gluon-API.jpg" alt="Cutting-edge IT trends for 2018 - Cloud, Big Data, AI, ML and IoT_4" width="1200" height="628" />We are sure Gluon will be heartily welcomed in 2018 and will become one of the main tools in any AI developer’s toolkit.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on the cutting-edge IT trends for 2018</h2>
<p>2018 will definitely be the year multiple cloud, Big Data, IoT and AI/ML projects enter the production-grade phase. Tools like Spark, JupyteR, Gluon and others will find their way to the hearts and toolkits of the enterprise specialists. People responsible for the digital transformation and increased efficiency of Business Intelligence &amp; Big Data analytics in their companies must keep a close eye on these trends and adopt the solutions once they are ready.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The financial industry has always been one of the most powerful influencers and consumers of technological innovation.<br />
<span id="more-1788"></span>The banks were the first to leverage trains for postal services, introduce fire alarms and CCTV surveillance. Now they do the same with Machine Learning. Machine learning (ML), as a part of greater Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry, evolves rapidly. While it reached several significant milestones already (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deep Blue defeating Kasparov</a> 20 years ago, or Google’s DeepMind algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AlphaGO defeating the GO champion Lee Sedol</a> in 2016, or <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2017/01/25/artificial-intelligence-used-identify-skin-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google’s algorithm trained to tell cats from dogs and used to identify skin cancer</a>), the business needs more practical — and, yes, by “practical” we mean “feasible” — ways to apply ML in daily operations.</p>
<p>This time has come, and today we will tell you of top 5 Machine Learning use cases for the financial industry, so you know <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Advanced%20Electronics/Our%20Insights/How%20artificial%20intelligence%20can%20deliver%20real%20value%20to%20companies/MGI-Artificial-Intelligence-Discussion-paper.ashx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">why venture capitalists and banks invested around $5 billion dollars in AI and ML in 2016</a>, according to McKinsey.</p>
<h2>Customer self-service portals</h2>
<p>Call Centers are a thing of the past, as the generations of computer-savvy people enter the banking world. Both Millennials and Gen Z prefer customer self-service portals and mobile banking through their smartphones. According to Business Insider, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chatbots-vs-humans-for-customer-relations-2016-12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more than 44% of US consumers prefer interacting with chatbots</a>, not with human representatives. Deploying ML algorithms to serve as chatbots might allow saving up to $27 billion in salaries in insurance and financial sectors. This also excludes the human error factor, as ML algorithm never sleeps, never yells at the customer, constantly learns and becomes only better over time.</p>
<h2>Risk Management in Banks and Financial Institutions</h2>
<p>Risk management is another field where implementing ML can lead to drastic improvement of results. When the algorithm is able to analyze the whole variety of incoming data (both internal, from the company business flow, and external, like customers’ search queries and social interactions), both beneficial or potentially dangerous trends can be recognized and exploited or mitigated. Yet another brilliant <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-future-of-bank-risk-management" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">research on the future of risk management in banks from McKinsey</a> states that “risk management is crucial for success and financial health of the banks and other institutions; ML is the key element, allowing to evaluate all the factors to make a well-grounded decision, and every new piece of information processed by the algorithm makes its predictions more accurate.”</p>
<h2>Compliance checks</h2>
<p>Many regulatory documents like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">USA PATRIOT Act</a> require a thorough and in-depth analysis of the financial background for many customers in many types of transactions. This means every financial institution has to employ a compliance team that has to constantly analyze and update a huge pool of information regarding their customers and prospects. Add the splits, mergers, and acquisitions into play, and you will clearly see why this is a hell of a job. Implementing ML algorithms can help the compliance department direct all the influx of data from various disparate systems and sources to a centralized storage, to be stored, processed and exploited efficiently. This will bring the customer screening to a much higher level.</p>
<h2>Credit Portfolio Management (CPM)</h2>
<p>Monitoring the health of credit portfolio is equally, if not more important to checking the background of the prospects. Leveraging the power of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/10-hot-trends-big-data-analytics-2017/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">machine learning for data analytics</a> allows for a much more precise predictive and prescriptive analysis. This will help predict what customers are at high risk of canceling their deposits or defaulting on their loans. As a result, the bank executives will be able to intervene and prescribe a much more personalized approach, keeping the credit portfolio healthy and drastically reducing the percentage of irretrievable loans. Yet another McKinsey report describes <a href="https://go.forrester.com/wp-content/uploads/Forrester_Predictions_2017_-Artificial_Intelligence_Will_Drive_The_Insights_Revolution.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the growing role of AI in retrieving valuable insights from the unstructured data</a> and the benefits it brings for banks.</p>
<h2>Robo advisors for wealth management</h2>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1790" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ML_Use_Cases_Finance_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="ML_Use_Cases_Finance_ITSvit_2" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>Being wealthy doesn&#8217;t always mean being well financially educated. Rich people often prefer delegating their wealth management to trusted financial institutions. When all the data about such fortunes, along with all the transactions and events in various important fields is processed by a robo advisor, the consulting financial structure is able to make swift actions. Such actions might include selling dangerous assets or buying cheap once the opportunity arises, thus ensuring optimal allocation of the customer’s resources and all-around good performance of the assets. Blackrock, one of the world&#8217;s-leading investment management funds, has published a detailed <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/en-at/literature/whitepaper/viewpoint-digital-investment-advice-september-2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">report regarding the efficiency of employing robo advisors for asset management</a>.</p>
<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>Financial institutions have to follow the latest technology to secure their bottom line and provide the best service to their customers. About a decade ago, offering an online service was the way to gain a competitive edge. Around 5 years ago a mobile app became an essential component of a good offering. Nowadays, employing an AI algorithm is what can push the business ahead of less tech-savvy competitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of bright inventions around us and new ones happen daily. However, while some new technologies come and go barely noticed, the others cause real hype and become the true disruption <span style="font-weight: 400;">in their field. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-1459"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of such technologies is machine learning, which — if applied right — has the potential to improve the business practices, increase the ROI and result in higher customer satisfaction with your products and services. That is why in this article we list the top 5 reasons to implement machine learning today in order to reap the benefits in the nearest future.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Machine Learning (ML) is the recently developed technology of using adapting algorithms deployed in the cloud to analyze Big Data and find emerging patterns without actually knowing what to look for. </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows for more precise analytics of the ongoing processes, finding room for improvement and avoiding possible failures proactively, instead of facing the consequences, thus improving the bottom line, customer satisfaction, and employee engagement. This is a huge market, with $5 billion in venture capital invested in machine learning startups in 2016. As a matter of fact, a fresh </span><a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory-services/digital-iq/assets/pwc-digital-iq-report.pdf#515" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report on digital IQ from PWC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the world leading consultancy and analytics providers, showed that 30% of respondents expect machine learning to disrupt their field of business within the next 5 years! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are the reasons to implement machine learning every company can have:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Personalized service for prospects and customers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Call centers are a dying form of service, as Millennials prefer self-service portals with chatbots. As a matter of fact, </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chatbots-vs-humans-for-customer-relations-2016-12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">44% of US customers preferred chatbots over real customer service reps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if the experience was right and the bots were able to quickly help the customer solve the issue. ML algorithms help automate the service and even if a real customer service has to intervene — the algorithm will analyse their actions to be able to solve such issues in the future.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Better applicant screening for HR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Due to the simplicity of access to information, there can be hundreds or even thousands of applications for every job posting. Shortlisting these candidates for an interview can be a really daunting task. A specialized ML algorithm can use preset filters and sort out the applicants that lack required technical skills or other needed features, thus greatly decreasing the time  and effort spent on applicant screening.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Improved financial interactions for the billing department</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Customers can send payments with some details lacking, and finding out where the sum should be applied can be a real pain. A specialized machine learning algorithm can analyse such payments and predict the missing details, making processing daily financial operations much less stressful for the financial department.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Better employee engagement and retention</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A good paycheck is not the most important part of the job reward any more. As a matter of fact, 35% of respondents to PWC survey on Millennials at work stated corporate training and professional development programmes to be the most convincing feature when choosing a new job. Quite opposite, routine tasks can cause boredom and frustration, which might result in talent loss.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying machine learning can help analyse the data like the history of social interactions and browser searches to provide valuable insights into the employee&#8217;s emotional state. This helps to understand if everything is fine, or is the talent thinking of a better haven and some additional motivation is needed to keep them engaged. This is especially beneficial for L&amp;D departments that should provide personnel with the opportunities to learn, grow as professionals and improve their satisfaction with the job.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Market predictions and business opportunities</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are lots of possibilities to apply machine learning in business practices. From stock exchange and bitcoin trading to analysing the industry-related news feeds, ability to gain insights on important events before they gain notion can provide a competitive edge. For example, learning of a fire at the competitor’s factory that will disrupt their operations can help a business form a targeted special offer package to win the customers that will be inevitably dissatisfied with unfulfilled obligations of the competitor. This approach will be of great help in <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/top-5-machine-learning-use-cases-financial-industry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">finances</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/5-use-cases-machine-learning-banking-industry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">banking industry</a>, insurance, and other industries.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Final thoughts on the top 5 reasons to implement Machine Learning</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The era of dinosaurs is long gone and we are not talking of archeology here. Being competitive often means being swift in nowadays business world. The one who is well informed is well armed, and machine learning, if implemented right, can become exactly the tool to help analyse all the richness of Big Data and come up with influential insights on a variety of business processes. </span></p>
