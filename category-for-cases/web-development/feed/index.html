Since then, IT Svit has advanced much in using such technologies, which allowed the team to deliver video call features in a timely manner.</span></p>

<h2>Case info</h2>

<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer had the following project specifications:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online video conferencing should work directly from the browser without any additional software or extensions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature should support mobile devices, as well as multiple desktop platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several core features should include screen sharing, chat, audio muting, speaker highlighting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system should provide automatic recovery on disconnection and easily switch between WiFi and 3G/4G/5G/LTE</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User-friendly interface</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature should enable meeting recording and replayability</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges and solutions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to build this application using a peer-to-peer approach when all the call participants have equal rights and share the resource workload, without anybody having to support a dedicated server for video streaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest challenge encountered was building a platform for stable connectivity. We developed a specific component for client applications enabling them to switch to alternative Internet access routes with minimum connection disruption. This enabled seamless switching between WiFi and mobile Internet access for mobile devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad Internet connection was a big issue even for web app performance. On the testing stage, some users experienced connectivity issues during their calls even on desktop devices with landline Internet connections. A built-in WebRTC feature constantly monitors the connection performance and lowers the bitrate of video/audio streams automatically if the connection becomes worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turned out that Safari on iOS does not support RTCDataChannel, so we had to use web socket technology for arbitrary data transfer. This allowed us to enable the system to work even with Safari just as well as with all other browsers.</span></p>
<h2><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7669" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Results.gif" alt="" width="1900" height="645" /></h2>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We integrated video calls into Hurma in a timely manner using our previous developments in this area. The ability to call anyone anytime directly from the browser has significantly simplified communication for recruiters, candidates, employees and HR managers. In addition, the ability to record all the calls (after the explicit consent) enabled the HR/recruiting specialists to replay any call later on. </span></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The peer-to-peer approach helped us minimize resource consumption, as the main flow of data goes between clients, not from clients to a server. A simple API of the video conferencing system allowed us to easily customize UI to meet customer requirements for various cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Svit has proven its DevOps, Python development and software integration expertise once more, providing a simple and reliable tool for online communications directly from a browser.</span></p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/online-meeting-functionality-for-hurma/">Online meeting functionality for Hurma</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>IT Svit had to ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The portal had to be able to interact with other travel industry tools through an API</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Full-stack development</b> for both websites,</li>
<li><b>Cloud infrastructure</b> design for their deployment,</li>
<li><b>Ongoing QA</b> and improvement of the services.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Skillbyte GmbH has their own Content Management System (CMS). Few biggest enterprise clients in the German market asked for the system showcase with the requirement for it to be set up on the AWS. Therefore, we built an out-of-the-box solution that uses the cloud technology to rapidly deliver scalable, easily configurable and manageable infrastructure to score the contracts.</p>
<p><span id="more-6029"></span></p>
<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>The main customer pains were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CMS itself is a <b>monolith product</b> built in Java, with more than <b>100 modules</b>.</li>
<li>There are more than <b>15 processes</b> interacting with each other, creating <b>high workload</b>.</li>
<li>A <b>setup process was a real pain</b> for the customers and required following a <b>complicated checklist</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project results</h2>
<p>The product is now enterprise-grade and production-ready. The customers acquired by this setup are a truck manufacturing giant, several leading media and a popular retailer, just to list a few. The process of the CMS setup and deployment is now fully-automated and the product has also got features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 commands and around 15 minutes of time to deploy the CMS(<b>previously it took 2 weeks to deploy</b>)</li>

<h3>Client goals</h3>
<p>One of the features of the CMS is the rigidity of the page layout, which is configured in front end service. It allows the content to be updated in a web interface by anyone who has appropriate permissions, without the necessity to meddle with the source code itself. The client wanted us to provide the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Migrate </b>the showcase from Mesos/Marathon environment<b> to Kubernetes</b></li>
<li><b>Shorten the product deployment</b> time</li>
<li><b>Add</b> the missing <b>features</b></li>
<li><b>Configure error-proof update</b> and recovery procedures</li>
<li>Introduce the <b>Continuous Delivery pipeline</b> to automate the setup and configuration as much as possible.</li>
<li><b>Split </b>the monolith app <b>into microservices</b> to provide stability</li>
<li><b>Containerize the components</b> for scalability</li>
<li>Deploy an<b> in-depth monitoring and logging</b> solution</li>
</ul>
<p>That would make the product enterprise-ready, as it was aimed to be offered to high-level EU enterprises.</p>

<h3>Project implementation</h3>
<p>IT Svit performed a test deployment of the CMS and analyzed all the dependencies and possible bottlenecks an IT engineer might face. We then performed the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving the CMS from a Mesos/Marathon environment to a redundant Kubernetes cluster,</li>
<li>Containerizing the system components using Docker</li>
<li>Using Jenkins to enable Continuous Implementation / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline</li>
<li>Automating the product build and deployment using Ansible.</li>
<li>Automating the process of recovery for all the components in case of an interruption during the system update</li>
<li>Enabling the auto-scaling for the front-end service and automating its release cycle</li>
<li>Designing and developing a customized monitoring too</li>
</ul>
