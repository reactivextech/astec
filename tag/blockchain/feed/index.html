					<description><![CDATA[<p>The recent launch of the first cryptocurrency-based game, the CryptoKitties, was an important milestone for the whole blockchain industry. Aside from being a phenomenal success and attracting 100,000 new traders to the market, the app unveiled certain limitations in the Ethereum network functionality. Occupying 15% of the Ethereum network throughput capacity and increasing the transaction verification time by 600% raised several questions that need to be answered to ensure the blockchain technology is production ready and able to meet the demands of enterprise-grade projects.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/cryptokitties-help-blockchain-technology-evolve/">How CryptoKitties help the Blockchain technology evolve</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The game centered on collecting, breeding and trading virtual felines for ethers has taken the Ethereum network by storm. Here are certain important outcomes for the Blockchain technology as a whole.</p>
<p><span id="more-3057"></span></p>
<p>First of all, the CryptoKitties case is an important milestone in the evolution of the blockchain technology in general, and Ethereum network in particular. Aside from introducing a new business model that is sure to be used by many followers in the future, this use case brought the most important part of popularization — gamification.</p>
<p>What is this blockchain many people fuzz so much about? Cryptocurrency? Tokens? Mining? I don’t get it… Now, here are the CryptoKitties you can buy, breed and sell — that’s a whole other thing! And the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coinbase</a> adds <b>100,000</b> new users over the weekend as a result.</p>
<p>Currently, more than 200,000 Ethereum owners are actively engaged with CryptoKitties, and the amount of pending transactions has increased by <b>600%</b> in several days when the game was released last November. Thus said, the contracts related to the game formed around <b>15%</b> of the whole Ethereum network traffic, which led to several serious questions arising. One of these questions sounds like this: if one app can create such a bottleneck, is the Ethereum network actually ready for scaling?</p>
<h2>Lessons to be learned by Ethereum network</h2>
<p>In order to respond adequately to this question, the Ethereum miners had increased the limit of gas in one block, which ensured the increase of the quantity of data per block, and allowed faster transactions. This is only a short-term solution still because if the software development ecosystem begins to spawn new projects at a steady rate, the Ethereum network risks being not ready to deal with the load. For instance, a new Ethereum-based game, <a href="https://cryptocelebrities.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CryptoCelebrities</a> was released quite recently, and is growing in popularity like crazy!</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3059" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CryptoKitties-help-the-Blockchain-technology-evolve.jpg" alt="How CryptoKitties help the Blockchain technology evolve_1" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>Another great aspect is the way the consumers and the media react to the projects. No matter how useful or potentially profitable the blockchain-based project is; if there is no game to be played or fun to be had — the project is not likely to stir much attention and bring wide press coverage.</p>
<p>Finally, this virtual game is but an example of how new technology (well, not so new, as Ethereum is here for almost a decade already) can ignite significant traction quite unexpectedly. For example, the idea of creating a world wide web was floating around for decades, but the need for actually building it was foggy at best. Until the email was invented. The ability to send a digital message to anyone across the world and get a reply <b>INSTANTLY</b> — this was really groundbreaking for businesses and individuals at the time.</p>
<p>Even one such application has proved the usefulness and potential profitability of the Internet, which lead to multiple industries emerging, new business models appearing and millions of people being engaged in productive and highly-profitable jobs. All of this became possible because someone once said: “let’s send a digital letter over the network”.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3060" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CryptoKitties-help-the-Blockchain-technology-through-gamification.jpg" alt="How CryptoKitties help the Blockchain technology evolve_2" width="1200" height="628" /><br />
And now somebody says: “let’s represent the digital assets as cute little feline mascots”. Who knows what new applications and development opportunities will this lead to?</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on how CryptoKitties help the Blockchain technology evolve</h2>
<p>The release of CryptoKitties took the Ethereum network by storm. From one side, this helped popularize the industry quite a lot and attracted a significant amount of new players to the field. At the same time, this highlighted certain shortcomings in the organizational structure and architecture of the Ethereum blockchain technology. These lessons should be learned and the appropriate solutions are to be made in order to ensure the technology is ready for rapid scaling.</p>
<p>Because many <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/amazing-blockchain-projects-launched-2017/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">great blockchain projects</a> might be just around the corner, and they might cause unprecedented demand for the blockchain resources. Will the network be ready to provide these resources when the time comes? Even more importantly — will your business be the one launching such projects and reaping the benefits?</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/cryptokitties-help-blockchain-technology-evolve/">How CryptoKitties help the Blockchain technology evolve</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The blockchain technology can be effectively applied across a multitude of industries aside from cryptocurrency. The applications include real estate, banking, financial services, logistics, healthcare, and energy industry, among others. To say even more, the blockchain can help fight climate change in more ways than one. Would you like to know more?</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/5-ways-the-blockchain-can-help-fight-climate-change/">5 ways the blockchain can help fight climate change</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the business wants to maximize the profits, the ecologically-responsible consumers want to fight climate change. Here are 5 ways the blockchain can help with both.<br />
<span id="more-2796"></span></p>
<p>While each human being is individual, many of our habits are common throughout the society, and can thus be categorized, studied, and even influenced to increase the socium productivity as a whole, referred to as the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">swarm intelligence theory</a>”. Stimulating the society to reach more efficient and productive behaviors is a dream of all economists and large market players, as it helps them maximize their profits or minimize their expenses. This can be done using the blockchain technology, where every interaction stored in the decentralized database is final and transparent to all the network participants.</p>
<p>Just for example, the sewage processing plants in the US and the UK are built using similar technology and are based on the AD — the anaerobic digestion process, carried out by bacteria that produce methane out of biological waste. However, the yields of the US plants were around <b>50% lower</b> as compared to their British analogs working under similar load conditions. The research from Kleenex has shown this to be due to the fact the Americans use abundant quantities of 4-layer toilet paper, while the Englishmen suffice with quite a few sheets of 2-layer paper.</p>
<p>This leads to the US wastewaters carrying up to 10 times more cellulose, as compared to their UK analogs, thus resulting in much trouble for the bacteria and significantly worse methane production. Multiple blockchain solutions were proposed — from producing easily-dissolvable toilet paper (which happened to be not feasible) all the way up to direct legislation that resulted with the requests to throw toilet paper into the garbage cans in public places.</p>
<p>One of the best results, however, was achieved by Kimberly Clark, the manufacturer of toilet accessories. They moved from freely-rolling toilet paper dispensers to clipping devices that limit the amount of paper given per 1 visitor of a public toilet. Such simple solution resulted in a significant boost of income for waste processing companies, as it dramatically improved the output of methane from the AD factories, while also making public toilets more cost-efficient.</p>
<p>Another example of using the swarm theory in combination with high technologies can be seen in the decrease of average household energy consumption levels in the US and the UK, despite the growth of the numbers of various energy-consuming gadgets and home appliances. For example, a decade ago the ending of the episode of any popular sitcom or soap opera would result in huge spike or electricity usage, up to 650 MW at times, as millions of people rushed to switch on their kettles or coffee machines and make some tea or coffee.</p>
<p>Nowadays, this energy spike is only about 200 MW at best. Why so? Because many viewers have adopted time-shifted viewing to watch the show at their free time, or record it and view it on their mobile devices while they commute. As these devices are usually charged overnight, total energy consumption is blurred over many hours, lowering the strain on the energy grid.</p>
<p>Yet another example of applying the swarm theory to drive revenues would be the experience of <a href="https://www.airliquide.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Air Liquide</a>, a US manufacturer and operator of various gases for medical and chemical industries, like hydrogen and nitrogen. The company has several gas-generating facilities and operates a network of gas lines and a fleet of more than 400 trucks to deliver the gas to their consumers. When the business grew, operating the system was becoming more and more complicated, which began to cause delays in delivery.</p>
<p>Air Liquide adopted the system inspired by the collective mind of ants, who use pheromones to inform their hive of the whereabouts of food and the best approaches to get to it. The company hired a Big Data and AI solutions firm to design a data analytics system that processes millions of reports of the ready product stocks, placed orders, free lorries, available routes, and weather conditions along the way.</p>
<p>Thus said, each morning every truck driver receives a plan for daily movements, which sometimes forces them to drive for hundreds of miles, instead of choosing the shortest route themselves. Such approach removed the delays and allowed Air Liquide to utilize their assets with utmost efficiency, thus driving in millions of additional profit.</p>
<h2>Blockchain prospects of fighting the climate change</h2>
<p>Adding the blockchain technology into the mix allows empowering the swarm theory manyfold. We have already told of a few of <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/news/3-blockchain-experiments-aware/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain applications in the European energy sector</a>, land registry, and real estate trading. Much more initiatives are underway around the world, like the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2079334-blockchain-based-microgrid-gives-power-to-consumers-in-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">New York P2P energy market pilot</a>, or several more energy market-related projects in Europe.</p>
<p>Applying these tools would allow minimizing the expenses on energy production and distribution, but there are still more possibilities of leveraging the blockchain power in multiple industries to fight the climate change:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;">The recycling efficiency</li>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;">The food supply chains transparency</li>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;">The energy grid performance</li>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;">The environmental treaties compliance</li>
<li style="margin-top: 6px;">The charity expenditures</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2798" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5-ways-blockchain-can-help-fight-climate-change_1.jpg" alt="5 ways blockchain can skyrocket the profits and help fight climate change_1" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>We’ll explain each of these points in more detail below.</p>
<h3>Using the blockchain technology to bolster the recycling efficiency</h3>
<p>Despite all the legislation and fees on inefficient recycling, there are quite little incentives for well-planned recycling, so each city has to work out what’s best for them on their own. Should the recycling results be recorded with blockchain contracts, every network participant would be able to measure the result of every waste recycling initiative and adopt the best practices.</p>
<p>There are several waste-recycling programs on blockchain like <b>RecycleToCoin</b> or <b>Plastic Bank</b> already running across Europe. The former accepts plastic bottles to special machines across Europe, while the latter issues monetary rewards, cell phone charging or even cooking fuels for deposits of plastic waste in the third world countries.</p>
<h3>Blockchain helps control the food supply chains</h3>
<p>Counterfeit food products are the scourge of the supermarket shelves across the world. There are so many intermediates between the food producer and the end buyer that ensuring the product genuity is nearly impossible. A certain effort was made to ensure the product validity through the excise stamps, yet these can be forged too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/53487.wss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IBM launched the blockchain-based food safety program in China</a> last December and some efforts are in place to replace the faulty excise stamps with QR-codes maintained by a blockchain system. This will help reduce the amount of food fraud, the carbon footprint of food production, processing and delivery, and the expenses on ensuring the genuity of multiple food produce.</p>
<h3>P2P energy grid with the blockchain</h3>
<p>We have already mentioned multiple <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/news/blockchain-energy-industry-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">energy-related initiatives being developed or already powered by the blockchain technology</a>. The point is that if each member of the community is able to produce enough energy to power their own household and trade this energy with their neighbors through a P2P grid, the costly-to-build and maintain country-wide electric power lines become obsolete.</p>
<p>Projects like <b>SunContract</b> or <b>Transactive Grid</b> aim to turn this vision into reality and trade electric power between Individual Power Producers (IPP), omitting centralized utilities.</p>
<h3>Environmental compliance using the blockchain</h3>
<p>Despite signing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paris climate agreement</a> aimed to reduce the carbon emissions, many companies find it easier (and cheaper) to tamper with the reports than to actually implement eco-friendly technologies and upgrade their existing facilities.</p>
<p>Thus said, building the ledger of records on blockchain would prevent the cases of fraud and forgery of environmental reports and result in a more transparent and cost-efficient management of these records (as nearly <b>$1 billion</b> is spent annually to maintain the Paris Agreement record database).</p>
<h3>Charity funds control with the blockchain</h3>
<p>The same reasoning stands for introducing the blockchain ledger to the charity domain, as many corporations use it as a cover for their financial dipsy doodles. Many charity funds have turned into colossal money laundering machines with inefficient management and are quite slow to respond to the pressing needs of the community.</p>
<p>Forcing the charity to accept blockchain-based ledger of transactions would ensure transparency of such payments and greatly reduce the bureaucratic overhead of moving the funds from people with generous hearts to the people in need. In terms of fighting the climate change, the money intended for rewarding the eco-preserving activities can be delivered on reaching certain waypoints exactly to the parties involved, omitting multiple unintended bureaucratic pockets.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on 5 ways blockchain can help battle the climate change</h2>
<p>We live at the beginning of a new millennium, and relying on old and trusted ways just doesn’t work anymore. The nature-preserving and technologically-aware Millennials demand transparency, eco-friendliness and environmental responsibility from their food and utility providers. If the governmental agencies fail to deliver the solutions required, the swarm intellect moves the society in the needed direction, sometimes undermining the fields where the state has traditionally dominated.</p>
<p>The blockchain technology is a powerful tool that helps bring the power to the people, as it allows them to build trustless, decentralized and truly democratic systems without any regulatory organs or centralized authorities. This helps disrupt and innovate in a multitude of industries, including the ones that influence the climate change directly, like energy production, food processing, and waste recycling.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The explanations of the blockchain technology circulating in the network are full of technical terms that require much deeper understanding of the technology that an average citizen possesses. We tried to deal with this shortcoming in our new article and provided an explanation of what makes the blockchain technology tick in the terms your grandma would understand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The blockchain will shape the future of multiple industries, yet many people still don’t know how it works. We tried to make the blockchain technology explained in a way even a grandma will get.<span id="more-2614"></span>Understanding the benefits of the blockchain technology can be essential both for the startups and established businesses nowadays, as blockchain has long ago surpassed the boundaries of cryptocurrency. Nowadays, multiple <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/amazing-blockchain-projects-launched-2017/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain projects</a> are live in banking, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/blockchain-big-data-match-made-heavens/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Big Data analytics</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/news/blockchain-energy-industry-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">energy industry</a>, <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/real-estate-blockchain-start-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">real estate</a> and a variety of other industries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a>, the oldest of cryptocurrencies, is nearly a decade old. Multiple <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ico-future-startup-funding/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">startups raise funding through ICOs</a>, selling blockchain-based tokens instead of traditional equity shares.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2628" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How_Does_Blockchain_Work_ITSvit.jpg" alt="What_Is_Blockchain_Technology" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>Nonetheless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the blockchain technology</a> is still in the phase of early adoption by the innovators and enthusiasts, as the late majority is mostly perplexed by the system’s perceived complexity. Many of our customers are still somewhat confused by the terms like “<b>peer-to-peer trading</b>”, “<b>trustless agreement</b>”, “<b>distributed ledger</b>”, or “<b>double spending</b>”. We decided to describe the system in the terms an average consumer (like your grandma) would understand.</p>
<h2>Blockchain technology explained in plain English: a way to pay without banks</h2>
<p>Let’s assume you go to the supermarket and have $100 with you. You buy what you need and go to the cashier and say:<br />
&#8211; I will pay this check through an email to my bank, where I urge them to withdraw $100 from my account and pay you. This email will serve as a digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I.O.U.</a> that will be paid, 100% guaranteed.</p>
<p>The cashier (the shop owner, the merchant) gladly accepts your offer and goes to the bank. The bank agrees to the deal, withdraws $100 from your account and credits the shop owner’s account.</p>
<p>Sounds too good to be true, yeah? You still have the $100 banknote in your wallet, after all, so maybe you will be able to go and buy another pack of goods with it? Well, here is when the concept of “<b>double spending</b>” enters the game.</p>
<p>You are not alone in the market. You are surrounded by a crowd of people — other merchants, customers, guards, etc. All of them have heard your promise to pay the merchant by emailing this request to your bank. To say even more, ALL OF THEM want to receive the copy of this email, and some of them are ready to compete to be the first to receive and VALIDATE it.</p>
<p>Validation is the process of confirming the buyer’s and seller’s identity, the transaction time and sum, the buyer’s right of possession of the amount of money in question. Once the email is validated, it becomes <b>the truth</b> for all the people on the market. But who of the competitors will validate it? In other words, whose truth should we believe?</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2619" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How_Does_Blockchain_Work_ITSvit_1.jpg" alt="What_Is_Blockchain_Technology_1" width="1200" height="1256" /></p>
<p>The people who want to compete to get the right to validate the email should follow the rule (or <b>protocol</b>). They should solve a task that is hard to crack, yet with a solution quite simple to check — like Sudoku. The first one to crack the nut gets a reward (<b>Bitcoin</b> or any other <b>cryptocurrency</b>), so there are always people eager to participate. This reward is actually the I.O.U. statement itself, so people earn tangible assets by solving the puzzles to validate other people’s transactions — this is called “<b>mining</b>”.</p>
<p>Once the Sudoku is correctly solved, ALL the participants erase their calculations and write down the winner’s variant. Thus said, everybody around will know you must pay this $100 banknote to the shop owner and cannot spend it anywhere else (here is when double spending becomes impossible). Now, if your bank is just another merchant on the market (or the cryptocurrency exchange), there is no need to have bank notes and go to the bank at all.</p>
<p>This practice continues on and on for all the new transactions, thus achieving the state of the <b>distributed ledger</b>, where all network participants have identical sets of records, valid and unchangeable (<b>immutable</b>) over time. Why so? Because these records are composed into <b>blocks</b> and the blocks are linked into a <b>chain</b> (thus the name of the technology), with each next block storing <b>hashes</b> or short addresses of the previous blocks, so any transaction can be traced back in time.</p>
<p>Forging one set of records will give nothing, as at the next validation (in 10 minutes with Bitcoin) it will accept the truth from all the other network participants. You actually need to convince 51% of the network to accept your version of the truth, which is nearly impossible in 10 minutes (well, not feasible anyway).</p>
<p>Therefore, even though the network participants do not know the identities of people behind the wallets, they can testify to anyone asking that “this customer bought goods from this merchant and promised to pay for them with an email I.O.U.”. This is exactly what a “<b>trustless agreement</b>” is.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2629" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How_Does_Blockchain_Work_ITSvit_2.jpg" alt="What_Is_Blockchain_Technology_2" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<p>This forms a self-controlled, secure and resilient system where the rules are set by the architecture and there is no need for any intermediary like a Central Bank to grant the genuity of the means of payment, tell the parties if the transaction is possible, and take the fees for that.</p>
<p>Any of the people in the crowd can be in your place and trade with each other, passing money without the need for a centralized authority to set the rules (“<b>peer-to-peer banking</b>&#8220;). If someone goes back home from the market and misses some number of transactions, their sets of records will be updated once they re-enter the market.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on the blockchain technology explained</h2>
<p>Therefore, in a nutshell, blockchain is an immutable distributed set (or ledger) of records, stored in blocks that contain validated I.O.U.s. These blocks are chained to each other, so — with proper authorization — anyone can trace any transaction to the very beginning, removing the chance of foul play and fraud. Various blockchain projects like <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a> or <a href="https://ripple.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ripple</a> have varying protocols, yet in general, the architecture remains the same.</p>
<p>There are innumerable possibilities stemming from this technology. We have listed them before and have even developed some of our own (like this <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/blockchain-based-solution-document-workflow-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain solution for document workflow optimization</a> or this <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/apply-coupons-one-shop-another-using-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain-based eCommerce coupon management platform</a>).</p>
<p>We hope this article did provide a simple enough description of the blockchain, so you can now have the blockchain technology explained even to your grandma. Well, in some cases you might still need to explain what an email is, but this is outside the scope of this article.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The growth and evolution of Big Data analytics and the blockchain technology enable quite an interesting combination. For example, using blockchain to ensure data immutability and security allows dealing with possibly fraudulent transactions on the fly. There are some other interesting applications stemming from this cooperation. We disclose them in our new article.</p>
The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/blockchain-big-data-match-made-heavens/">Blockchain and Big Data: the match made in heavens</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big Data has been around for a while and blockchain technology currently rides the hype wave. What results can the concoction of these two innovations produce?<br />
<span id="more-2491"></span></p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 10px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;"><p>The blockchain is a decentralized ledger of transactions, where every network participant validates the transaction so that the data stored is immutable and cannot be forged.</p></blockquote>
<p>Due to the fact that cryptocurrencies and other <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/news/3-blockchain-experiments-aware/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">real-world applications of blockchain technology</a> are becoming more and more mainstream, the amount of transactional data stored within various ledgers becomes huge. Storing these vast data lakes at conventional cloud storage providers like <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-vs-ms-azure-cloud-provider-choose/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS or Azure</a> would cost quite a fortune. However, the pilot project launched by <a href="https://storj.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Storj</a> and other decentralized data storage providers showed up to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/30/when-blockchain-meets-big-data-the-payoff-will-be-huge/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>90% cost savings</b> as compared to AWS</a>.</p>

<p>In Japan, a consortium of nearly 50 banks has partnered with <a href="https://ripple.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ripple</a>, an open-source blockchain network with the world’s third largest market capitalization. The main use of such an alliance was using the blockchain technology to enable instant risk-free transaction at low cost. Conventional financial transactions are costly due to a high number of risks (and risk checks) involved. Opting for Ripple allowed the consortium <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/forty-seven-japanese-banks-move-towards-commercial-phase-using-ripple/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>decrease the time of processing a transaction significantly</b></a> and reduce the associated costs nearly to zero, by locking out multiple risk factors (like double-spending) altogether.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2495" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blockchain_And_Big_Data_ITSvit_1.jpg" alt="Blockchain_Meets_Big_Data_3" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<h2>Combining blockchain and Big Data: the new level of analytics</h2>
<p>Using blockchain adds another data layer to the Big Data analytics process. Most importantly, this data layer complies with 2 main demands of the Big Data analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blockchain-generated Big Data is <b>secure</b>, as it cannot be forged due to the network architecture.</li>
<li>Blockchain-based Big Data is <b>valuable, </b>meaning it is structured, abundant and complete, making it a perfect source for further analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>The data in the ledger can relate to energy trading, real estate and a variety of other domains. There are multiple Big Data analytics improvements stemming from this fact. For instance, <b>fraud prevention</b>, as the blockchain technology allows the financial institutions check every transaction real-time. Thus said, instead of analyzing the records of the fraud that already happened, the banks are able to identify risky or fraudulent transactions on the fly and prevent the fraud entirely.</p>
<p>Big Data is an incredibly profitable business, with revenues expected to grow to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/01/20/6-predictions-for-the-203-billion-big-data-analytics-market/#e0d77e520838" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$203 billion by 2020</a>. To say even more, by 2030 the data contained in the blockchain ledger might be worth up to 20% of the global Big Data market and <a href="http://www.mo-data.com/turning-bitcoin-mining-into-big-data-mining/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">generate up to $100 billion</a> in annual income.<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2494" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blockchain_And_Big_Data_ITSvit_3.jpg" alt="Blockchain_Meets_Big_Data_2" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<h2>Conclusions on the combination of Big Data and blockchain</h2>
<p>Sure enough, blockchain and Big Data are a match made in heavens. The real question nowadays is who will be the first to provide the most suitable and best trained AI/machine learning model operating on top of distributed, transparent and immutable blockchain-generated data layers. The business to do this will roll in investments and generate immense profits.</p>
<p>50 world’s largest mineral mining companies are worth about <b>$700 billion</b> combined. The market capitalization of the blockchain-powered big data mining platforms will undoubtedly be in trillions. Will your company be amongst them?</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/blockchain-big-data-match-made-heavens/">Blockchain and Big Data: the match made in heavens</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/amazing-blockchain-projects-launched-2017/">The most amazing Blockchain projects launched 2017</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2017 was the third year in a row nearly doubling the amount Blockchain-based projects launched on GitHub. 15,000 were launched in 2015; 26,000 in 2016 and nearly 50,000 in 2017.<br />
<span id="more-2354"></span></p>
<p>These impressive numbers were taken from the annual <a href="https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/industry/financial-services/evolution-of-blockchain-github-platform.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deloitte report on the Blockchain technology evolution</a>. The interest in practical applications of the tech is rapidly growing, as Bitcoin nearly reached a whopping $20,000 per coin this December and multiple Blockchain-based services and systems go live across the globe.</p>
<p>However, harsh realities of startup life do apply to the blockchain startups. <b>Out of 26,000</b> blockchain-based Github projects launched in 2016, <b>only 8% are active as of 2017</b>. Deloitte researchers elaborated on the matter, saying that:</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 10px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;"><p>Only 8% of the Blockchain-based projects on GitHub are active (were updated at least once during the last 6 months). Organizations perform better than individuals, as 15% of their submitted projects remain active vs 7% of the individual projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>San Francisco was mentioned as a home area for nearly 1,400 Github project owners, with London climbing to the second place with over 900 projects, and New York sitting on the third step with about 780. In addition, Chinese cities of Shanghai and Beijing played home for a huge number of cryptocurrency-related projects, mostly aimed at scalable cross-currency trading.</p>
<h2>Blockchain apps and systems from industry leaders</h2>
<p>Japanese <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2017/1115-01.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fujitsu corporation released a cryptocurrency exchange system</a> this November, while the central banks of Hong Kong and Singapore began developing their own blockchain-based network. IBM announced their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/10/on-the-horizon-new-blockchain-solution-for-cross-border-payments/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain-based cross-border payment platform</a>, developed in conjunction with a number of international financial bodies and Stellar, the open-source network behind Ripple, the world’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/12/ripple-ceo-regulators-right-to-ban-fraud-cryptocurrency-sales.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">third-largest market cap cryptocurrency</a>. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/walmart-blockchain-food-tracking-test-results-encouraging/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Walmart is using blockchain-based applications</a> to track food and underpin unmanned delivery services.</p>
<p>Thus said, the interest in blockchain is steaming and the hype train does not show any sign of slowing down. However, as Bitcoin becomes largely a toy for the rich investors (we know you are breeding your <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Crypto Kitties</a> already, don’t you?), much of the low- and mid-size trading is currently directed at lower-priced cryptocurrencies. For example, Litecoin showed 70x growth from $5 to $350 in slightly less than 6 months!</p>
<p>Joshua Nussbaum of New-York VC firm Compound collected a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xvTjM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">list of Blockchain projects that gained significant traction in 2017</a>. These are split according to the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Currencies (including the ones with emphasis on privacy)</li>
<li>Developer tools (smart contracts, scaling, oracles, security, compliance, etc.)</li>
<li>Fintech (trading, insurance, lending, investment management, etc.)</li>
<li>Security (governance, communication, identity protection, etc.)</li>
<li>Value exchange (content monetization, file storage, mesh networking, etc.)</li>
<li>Shared data (IoT, logistics, content curation, reputation management, etc.)</li>
<li>Authenticity (data values, ticketing systems, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>We list the projects in these categories and provide brief explanations on each of them.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2357" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blockchain_Projects_2017_ITSvit_3.jpg" alt="Amazing_Blockchain_Projects_Launched_2017_3" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets are one of the most profitable fields of investment nowadays, with commission sums totalling $200-$400 million USD daily. Despite Bitcoin being the oldest and the most popular cryptocurrency, various coins like <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://litecoin.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Litecoin</a>, or <a href="https://ripple.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ripple</a> aim to improve certain aspects of the protocol. For example, <a href="https://getmonero.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Monero</a> and <a href="https://z.cash/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ZCash</a> specialize in concealed transactions, which can be of use to discreet investors or enterprises aiming to keep their investments protected from prying eyes.</p>
<p>Many companies and businesses worldwide (from small vendors all the way up to transnational giants like Amazon) add cryptocurrencies as the means of payment for their products and services. Bitcoin is the leader of the list, as it is the industry leader, yet it is quite limited in possibilities with its transaction pool and 2 MB block size. Other cryptocurrencies, with bigger blocks and better throughput will rule this wave.</p>
<h2>Developer Tools</h2>
<p>There are multiple projects oriented at improving the functionality and scalability of the available infrastructure. These products might even serve as components for the future Web 3.0 devstack, as they prioritize interoperability and decentralized apps. The tools like, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Geth</a>, <a href="https://www.nucypher.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NuCypher</a>, <a href="https://zeppelinos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ZeppelinOS</a>, <a href="https://truebit.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Truebit</a> and <a href="http://internetofagreements.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mattereum</a> can become crucial in combining features and functionality from multiple protocols to form new applications.</p>
<h2>FinTech projects</h2>
<p>Just as a stock or foreign exchange is a place where stocks or currencies can be traded for one another, the need for a Decentralized Exchange or DEX for trading tokens and cryptocurrencies is rapidly becoming obvious. The tools like <a href="https://0xproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">0x protocol</a>, <a href="https://www.bancor.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bancor</a>, and <a href="https://counterparty.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Counterparty</a> enable such transactions, allowing the investors to adjust their investment profiles to their liking with ease. This also enables the blossoming of various lending projects like <a href="https://www.wetrust.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WeTrust</a> and funds/investment management solutions like <a href="https://www.iconomi.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IConomi</a>.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>As cryptocurrency protocols are trustless by default, they can serve as a perfect medium and provide the required functionality to enable the world where the security is not achieved through the strict standards induced by authoritative bodies, but through unbeatable incentives and unbreakable rules. The projects like <a href="https://blockstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BlockStack</a>, <a href="https://aragon.one/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a> or <a href="https://rivetzintl.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">RivetZ</a> aim to do this.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2355" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blockchain_Projects_2017_ITSvit_1.jpg" alt="Amazing_Blockchain_Projects_Launched_2017_1" width="1200" height="628" /></p>
<h2>Value exchange</h2>
<p>Being a true upheaval the blockchain technology is, it allows implementing the ways to exchange multiple values without a currency as an intermediate. The most obvious example is the cloud computing industry, where various computational resources are now sold separately (serverless computing, storage space, etc.). Why not trading the excesses of these resources? The giants currently battling for domination in these economies of scale (like the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/aws-vs-ms-azure-cloud-provider-choose/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS vs Azure</a> competition) can be overthrown only by better-organized economies of scale, and blockchain is primed to do the job.</p>
<p>The other field of application lies within hiring freelancers for cryptocurrencies or trading computational power for tokens. Multiple startups like <a href="https://ethlance.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ethlance</a>, <a href="https://streamium.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Streamium</a>, <a href="https://golem.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Golem</a>, <a href="https://experty.io/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Experty</a> or <a href="https://storj.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Storj</a> open wide range of possibilities for entrepreneurial investors.</p>
<h2>Shared data</h2>
<p>All the airlines worldwide have to push their records into centralized data storages, in order to better allocate their inventories and adjust the routes and pricing if needed. These Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) are actually huge shared data pools, and the services like <a href="https://www.kayak.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kayak</a> allow surfing those lakes with ease.</p>
<p>When the same principle is applied to the blockchain, where the data is actually immutable long-term inventory item, incredible opportunities for collaboration and cooperation reveal themselves. Just imagine, what a huge benefit would it be for eBay to developing open APIs that would allow third parties to build a vast P2P commerce ecosystem based on eBay reputation. As reputation is a thing slowly built and easily wasted, keeping their public record clean and untampered would be an all-commanding impulse for all the traders, as the cases of fraud would become immediately widely known and non-removable from the database.</p>
<p>Currently, the projects like <a href="https://bitconnect.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bitconnect</a>, <a href="https://sweetbridge.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sweetbridge</a> or <a href="https://userfeeds.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Userfeeds</a> aim to implement such functionality and approach to reputation management.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on blockchain projects from 2017 you might want to monitor</h2>
<p>A multitude of blockchain projects have started or accomplished in 2017. We have described some of them in our articles on <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/ico-future-startup-funding/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ICO as the future of startup funding</a>, a release of the <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/news/mastercard-releases-blockchain-api-banks-partners/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MasterCard blockchain API</a>, and <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/news/blockchain-energy-industry-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain applications in the energy industry</a>. Cryptocurrencies and various applications of their protocols open even more possibilities for optimization of resource allocation and better return on investments.</p>
<p>The point to keep in mind, though, is that when 1 machine begins doing the work 10 people used to do, these 10 people become redundant and, consequently, unemployed. Thus said, when you consider playing with a new tech, be prepared for the need to tear off several long-term employees with decent industry experience, or trying to turn them into sales, which is least likely going to work.</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 10px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;"><p>On the other hand, if you do not tackle this problem at once, it is your job and business that might be in peril, if the competition employs the blockchain first.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus said, these are quite a few blockchain projects you might want to monitor in order to remain competitive and prepared for the incoming industry disruption. Are you ready?</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/amazing-blockchain-projects-launched-2017/">The most amazing Blockchain projects launched 2017</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain technology is not a buzzword anymore. With Bitcoin steadily gaining popularity, companies worldwide seek to employ the technology to utilize blockchain in many other sectors.<br />
<span id="more-1953"></span>The main benefits of blockchain lie within its architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a decentralized ledger of transactions, meaning there is no controlling entity or a single failure point of the network</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As there is no governing body, all the participants have equal rights</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">All participants have the exact same copies of the ledger, so no foul play is possible</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain system provides unmatched security, helping avoid counterfeit and fraud</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to this, blockchain technology is a natural choice for electronic government, keeping records of important documents (like financial transactions and official documents) and peer-to-peer transactions that can make many current entities obsolete &#8211; from centralized utilities to banks. Even the heat generated while mining the cryptocurrency can be utilized.</p>
<p>In fact, Amazon was going to launch a pilot project, where the hot water used to cool down the data center would be used to <a href="http://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/seattles-plan-warm-city-data-center-waste-heat/728113325" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">heat several nearby living blocks of residential areas in Seattle</a>. This project was put on hold due to bureaucratic resistance from the local utility providers, yet the idea can be brought to life relatively easy. Such initiatives are actually in place in <a href="http://www.decentralized-energy.com/articles/2017/09/facebook-data-center-to-heat-danish-city.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Denmark by Facebook</a> and in <a href="http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/power-cooling/yandex-data-center-heats-finnish-city/95529.fullarticle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Finland by Yandex</a>. Many data centers are already being built with heat reuse in mind, like the new <a href="https://stockholmdataparks.com/2017/07/07/new-hm-data-center-with-heat-recovery-in-stockholm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">H&amp;M data center in Stockholm, Sweden</a>.</p>
<p>This is but the simplest way of using the data center heat (including the one generated by blockchain processing). There are many other industries that can leverage blockchain to bring innovation and improvement to their customers. Here are 3 areas where blockchain is actively used nowadays, with examples.<br />
<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1955" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Blockchain_Experiments_To_Aware_Of_ITSvit._2.jpg" alt="Blockchain_Experiments_To_Aware_Of_ITSvit._2" width="1000" height="418" /></p>
<h2>Creating a transparent peer-to-peer energy market</h2>
<p>There are multiple endeavors by power utilities and startups across the EU, trying to <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/news/blockchain-energy-industry-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">change the rules of the game for the energy market</a> in order to provide a more decentralized and flexible model. When the energy consumer can contact the energy producer directly and can choose amongst several providers — a cheaper atomic energy, a slightly more expensive coal energy or not too widespread, yet steadily emerging renewable energy — <a href="http://energypost.eu/britains-switch-to-low-carbon-energy-could-give-a-21-billion-boost-to-the-economy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the energy industry will reduce the operational costs</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and can yield billions of euros in additional income.</span></p>
<p>While being hugely beneficial for the customers, such a system still raises several questions. Who will pay for the maintenance and repairs of the power grid? This is currently maintained by the utilities with the costs included in the energy pricing. How do the currently existing power-generating and distributing companies fit to the scheme? Simply closing these entities for good will create a massive unemployment wave, so this is not an option.</p>
<p>These questions should be answered before implementing the blockchain-based transparent energy marketplaces across the EU.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1956" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Blockchain_Experiments_To_Aware_Of_ITSvit._3.jpg" alt="Blockchain_Experiments_To_Aware_Of_ITSvit._3" width="1000" height="418" /></p>
<h2>Real estate and property trading using blockchain ledgers</h2>
<p>The aforementioned transparency, immutability and security of blockchain ledgers make them a perfect medium for carrying out records and transactions of important purchases, like land and real estate records. For example, the Lantmäteriet, the Swedish land registry has officially begun registering the land and real estate properties <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sweden-officially-started-using-blockchain-to-register-land-and-properties" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">using the blockchain technology</a>. The government of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/02/07/the-first-government-to-secure-land-titles-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-expands-project/#57e6c1884dcd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Georgia has begun securing land titles using Bitcoin</a> blockchain since the February of 2017, the pilot was completed by the BitFury company.</p>
<p>We have also quite recently described a <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/real-estate-blockchain-start-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">real estate blockchain by a start-up from Ukraine</a>, and there were successful cryptocurrency-funded <a href="http://qha.com.ua/en/economics/first-real-estate-sold-for-crypto-currency-in-ukraine/141739/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">purchases of homes, apartments and other properties in Ukraine, Dubai and the U.S</a>.<br />
<img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1959" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Blockchain_Experiments_To_Aware_Of_ITSvit_4.jpg" alt="Blockchain_Experiments_To_Aware_Of_ITSvit_4" width="1000" height="418" /></p>
<h2>Hyperledger, the cryptocurrency-free ledger</h2>
<p>The main problem with using blockchain technology to build decentralized banking lies within the fact the Proof of Work concept was never meant to be used for that purpose. That is why more than 80 companies (including the members of Linux Foundation, Intel and IBM) have created the <a href="https://medium.com/chain-cloud-company-blog/hyperledger-vs-corda-pt-1-3723c4fa5028" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hyperledger Project</a> — the cryptocurrency-free ledger.</p>
<p>This system is expected to process up to 100,000 transactions per second and will definitely be a supreme tool of the trade for e-government entities and processing the document flows of huge international corporations, which is why so many of them are backing the project. Moving from the old scheme of sending signed documents via snail mail or express delivery services to a decentralized, transparent and fraud-proof blockchain ledger will drastically increase the speed of processing the business-related documents, while also cutting on expenses and providing extreme security.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>We listed but 3 examples of blockchain use for the business, yet there can be dozens more. Wherever the business or government agencies need to provide speed, transparency and security &#8211; the blockchain technology stands ready to lend a hand. Do you know of any more examples of successful blockchain implementation?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spending funds efficiently and providing transparent transactions is essential for any business, yet the electric power industry is the one most appropriate for blockchain projects. Here is why.<br />
<span id="more-1914"></span></p>
<p>If oil is the blood of the modern economy, the electrical grid is its neural system. Electrical energy is needed everywhere &#8211; from lighting our houses in the night and all the way up to running machinery on the plants, computers in the offices and servers in the data centers. This turns building an efficient power grid and creating a transparent market for electric power into one of the top priorities nowadays. This is why many companies work on adding blockchain into the mix.</p>
<p>Below are several examples of what lies ahead of the energy industry as blockchain makes its way to it.</p>
<h2>Blockchain can help collect fees for charging the vehicles</h2>
<p>RWE, one of the leading German electric utilities, is conducting a full-scale testing of a <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/13394/blockchain-may-fuel-the-energy-industry" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain app for collecting fees for charging electric vehicles</a>. Being a neat tool for a soon-coming economy of machine-to-machine (m2m) interactions, such an app will help the car drivers pay for charging their vehicles on the network of electric charging stations, and this money will be paid to the electric power producers, omitting any intermediary banking institution.</p>
<p>RWE works closely with a German startup Slock.it to provide the drivers with the ability to pay for charging their vehicles using smart contracts issued using blockchain ledgers. With the EU automotive market being much inclined to the hybrid and electric vehicles, this app might be in a high demand quite soon.<br />

<h2>Power utilities can trade using blockchain, and Wien Energie is in the lead</h2>
<p>Wien Energie, an Austrian power utility was recently holding a pilot of a <a href="https://www.wienenergie.at/eportal3/ep/contentView.do/pageTypeId/67831/programId/74495/contentTypeId/1001/channelId/-53365/contentId/1801137" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blockchain tool for enabling the trade of gas with two other utilities</a>. Based on the Interbit trading platform from a Canadian startup BTL, this system proved useful for trading gas between three large energy-generating utilities. As Wien Energie is the Austria’s largest energy provider, they constantly seek to improve their leading position and secure their bottom line by providing more sophisticated services to their customers while reducing operational expenses. The use of smart contracts allows them to have a fraud-proof and transparent ledger of transactions.</p>
<h2>Smarter power grid control is essential for ongoing energy trade validation</h2>
<p><a href="http://gridsingularity.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Grid Singularity</a>, a Vienna-located startup, is actively testing its project for monitoring the grid state and trade power amongst the power-generating facilities and the consumers with the help of blockchain. Through the development of a decentralized energy data exchange tool, the company aims to provide all market players with access to interoperable, valid and protected data describing the power market stance real-time. This will underpin the efficiency and reliability of the future investor’s decisions, as well as allow easy access to the data on electricity production and consumption.<br />

<h2>Vattenfall unites 22 European energy traders using blockchain</h2>
<p><a href="http://news.vattenfall.com/en/article/forefront-field-trial-blockchain-technology" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vattenfall</a>, the leading power producer from Sweden, tests a Proof of Concept of a decentralized electric power marketplace till the end of 2017 and will launch it countrywide afterward. With 22 partners across the EU, Vattenfall aims to grant small-scale energy producers a simple, reliable and equal entrance to the energy trading and an ability to form smart contracts for their customers omitting any vertically-structured authorities like banks or huge utility providers. This will decrease the operational complexity and decrease the transaction costs, which will inevitably bolster the business efficiency and help inspire the economic growth.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Thus said, it is still unclear what lies ahead of blockchain and the energy industry. The goal of almost all ongoing projects is the same, nevertheless — creating an efficient, transparent, decentralized and interactive energy market, opening new possibilities for every player. Perhaps you also have a bright idea involving blockchain? Drop us a line and IT Svit will help bring your dream to life!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/blockchain-energy-industry-ahead/">Blockchain and Energy Industry: what is ahead?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain has much more to it than cryptocurrency. One of its most important features is the absolute transparency of the transactions, leaving no place for bribery and corruption.<br />
<span id="more-1698"></span><br />
Real estate and investments into it are one of the industries that can benefit from using Blockchain the most.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Propy</a>, a US-based start-up, created by a group of prominent American real estate businessmen and experienced Ukrainian developers, begins the pilot project that will allow people invest into real estate and buy it abroad in a much more secure, convenient and fast way than ever before. Founded in 2015, Propy aims to create a decentralized marketplace for buying real estate internationally and processing these cross-border payments using the power of blockchain.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1699" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Real_estate_blockchain_2.jpg" alt="Real_estate_blockchain_2" width="714" height="447"></p>
<p>This project caused some traction in the media and was covered in <a href="http://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/en/silicon-valley-startup-addresses-the-sustainable-lifestyle-in-middle-east/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/markcoleman/putting-the-real-into-sus_b_9311102.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post</a>, and real estate-centered <a href="https://www.inman.com/2016/11/17/blockchain-title-deeds-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Inman</a>.</p>
<h2>How does the blockchain help invest in real estate?</h2>
<p>In the beginning of 2016 Propy has released a working prototype of the blockchain-based transactions ledger and on the 15th of August, 2017, they held an ICO and issued 100 million tokens worth $1 each. 8 million of these are bought out as of 15th of September. Around October 2017 the company is going to launch a pilot project in Ukraine, whose moratorium on land trading has the bureaucratic complexity of the process as one of the main reasons. Propy has the full support of Ukrainian e-government division on the matter. A contract with the &nbsp;Chinese government has also been signed, as Chinese investors are ready and willing to <b>invest trillions of USD</b> into real estate development worldwide. Propy brokers will have their fixed commissions from successful sales, so it will be a win-win situation for all parties involved.</p>
<p>This is one of the first real-life applications of the blockchain technology outside of the cryptocurrency market. The marketplace will help with property search, cross-border payments, have blockchain ledger integration for the ease of governmental use, and make online issuing title deeds cost-efficient, instant and secure.</p>
<h2>Potential pros and cons of using the blockchain in real estate</h2>
<p>As of now, the legislation for regulating such purchases is absent worldwide, because this has never been done before. However, the tokens allow reserving the property until the legislative activities are complete. After that, the land-selling auctions can begin worldwide. This is forecasted to happen in early 2018, so taking part in the initiative now would be a wise choice. Everybody understands that once cross-border blockchain-powered real estate investments are legitimate worldwide, the properties will drastically grow in price…<br />
Should you like to use this opportunity, feel free to become the <a href="https://www.propy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Propy</a> investor and participant. However, maybe you have an idea of your own on how to use blockchain in some other industry? We have already accomplished several blockchain-based projects and gained quite an expertise on the matter.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain as a technology has been raising a great interest during the last time. It may even change the world, because of continuous evolving and obtaining new functionality.<br />
<span id="more-1407"></span></p>
<p>As we know, first blockchain was bitcoin. Rather simple idea, with clear and transparent workflow took minds of the enthusiasts. They were working hard on own blockchains and many altcoins were born as a result. But implementation of smart contracts to blockchain infrastructure brought us a new level of functionality.</p>
<p>Financial, government, medical, insurance sectors were interested in the new technology. What’s so special in blockchains? Why are these giant players so curious?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all blockchain has advantages, which look like a cure for multiple bottlenecks that these structures have in their workflow:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security &#8211; achieved by cryptography and hacker-proofness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transparency &#8211; every member of the network can check the ledger and see all transactions, which were made.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust &#8211; the idea of the blockchain that each member of the network doesn’t trust any other member. This issue is solved by mathematical methods without human factor. It means that all transactions are 100% trusted.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">P2P &#8211; connection between direct participant of the transaction.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>As was mentioned before, appearance of the smart-contracts changed the blockchains. Smart-contracts allow companies to customize the transactions to meet own requirements. For example, if the company has a standardized but complex document flow, which requires many manual approves, then it can be automated using blockchain. Why blockchain, you may ask. Automation can be done using standard approaches.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using blockchain advantages we will receive the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation of the document flow</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ledger &#8211; archive of the transactions that can’t be changed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excluding human-factor mistakes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving time</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1416" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/photo_2017-06-14_18-41-34.jpg" alt="photo_2017-06-14_18-41-34" width="620" height="365" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking good, isn’t it? Then why not to migrate to the blockchain globally? </span></p>
<p>There is some catch. This technology is young and was developed by small amount of geeks until governments and global corporation weren’t interested in it. Blockchain is not a silver bullet, it has many weak points, like oracles. Oracle (in Etherium terminology) &#8211; external source of the data, and as the data is stored outside the blockchain it can’t be trusted by default. And it is still the open question how we can validate it automatically. For example, if someone fills the financial document, how we can say if the inputted data is correct and this person tells us the truth.</p>
<p>The second disadvantage is low performance of the settlement. For example, we are making the financial payment. Bank can do it in seconds, but in blockchain we need to meet the several requirements to close the block and consider it as trustworthy, like with Proof of Stake. There is a chance that owners of the bigger amount of coins have nodes with poor resources. In this case their response time would be rather long.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1409" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gartner_hype_cycle.png" alt="gartner_hype_cycle" width="500" height="324" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third disadvantage is that for now all blockchain-based projects are fails in financial meaning. They are expensive, transactions can be expensive too. But now, in 2017, companies are just testing this approach and investigating the result. And it seems that the first half of the 2018 also would be the period of POCs. But the costs for developing definitely will be decreased as more and more developers and architects become interested in blockchain technology, therefore their salary would go down. As for decreasing the cost for the transaction &#8211; it’s hard to say now.</span></p>
<p>So, blockchain has a chance to change the internet and the world itself, but it needs to solve many issues to do it. Would these issue be solved and we can see the world with transparent information flow, simplified operations and without corruption, or it is just a romantic dream? We’ll see in the next few years. There are still a lot of sceptics, but remember, there were a lot of sceptics on the dawn of the Internet too.</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/blog/can-the-blockchain-change-the-world/">Can the blockchain change the world?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>
