										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Internet is at its peak, and it doesn’t seem like it might slow down for another 20 years. It certainly has made the world smaller, but also it has created the opportunity of working anywhere from the world.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-7464"></span>



<p>A Remote developer is someone who works for a tech company from home or while traveling. This method offers a significant amount of flexibility for developers, as all they need is a laptop and an Internet connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remote work is a great way to beat the 9-5 office work and be your boss. It is now a trend in tech industries, and candidates also choose to work from their home at their own time whenever possible.</p>



<p>Tech companies can also boost productivity by doing this as they have to use fewer resources behind the employee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, there are a lot of Outsourcing companies out there that provide developers based on a fixed price or hourly rates. Hiring an agency can help you with your future projects also, while a remote developer may take your project or not; a company will pick it.</p>



<p>While the option of working remotely from home sounds great but finding a good remote developer for your company is like climbing a straight mountain; no matter how good your grips are, there is always some hidden risk involved. It is true that with platforms such as <b>UpWork</b> and <b>Freelancer</b>, it is easy to look for developers as per your requirement, but with tens of thousands of developers available, it is difficult to filter the good ones.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Programming Languages</li><li>Client-Server Architecture</li><li>Systems Engineering</li><li>Basics of Software testing</li><li>Databases</li><li>Encryption and Cryptography</li><li><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/directory/services/list-blockchain-technology-companies">Blockchain</a></li><li>Artificial Intelligence</li><li>Cross-platform Software</li><li>Operating Systems</li><li><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/cloud-computing-companies/kharkiv">Cloud Computing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/devops-companies/kharkiv">DevOps</a></li></ul>



<p>However, to find a developer for your project, it is crucial that you first define certain milestones to be as productive as possible and get the best results to form the whole process.</p>



<p>These are the few to-do lists when you set out to search for Remote Developers for your project:</p>



<h2>1. Define your project &#8211; What exactly you require</h2>



<p>Setting your result before even starting anything is very important. Setting a goal that what you want to see when the project is completed helps you keep in mind what you require and how you can avoid unproductive things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before you hire anyone, you need to do this, now as easy as it sounds, but this task is much harder than it looks. You need to be sure what kind of developer you need for your project and what specific skills he/she should possess to get the desired results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this is the most simplistic manner, sit down with a pen and paper, and start listing all the technical aspects that you will need to complete during the entire duration of your project. Doing this will help you get a checklist of skills that you will require from any <b>Remote Developer</b> that you hire.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. Which developers do you need?</h2>



<p>It depends on what kind of developers your project demands; it may even be a case you won’t need a developer but designer who can design certain portions of your website, app, or software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experienced developers can be found who have considerable command over languages such as C++, ELK Java, + Angular, stack, JavaScript, Kubernetes, Python, Vue.js, Terraform, Jenkins, Node.js, Docker, Grafana Prometheus React, Ruby-on-Rails, and many more software development platforms.</p>



<p>Also, designers prepare mockups of apps, and Front-end developers have to take the mockups and turn them into visual codes, but it is the job of back-end developers to make that design functional so that when a user clicks on that button, it will give the desired response.</p>



<p>Depending on your project, there will be a need for a designer, front-end developer, or back-end developer or any other kind like a full-stack developer. This will get you a perfect person with the skillset required to complete your project. An outsourcing agency can provide you with even a team for the duration of your project.</p>



<h2>3. The budget for your project</h2>



<p>Budget is one of the most important things for a business owner or an entrepreneur because as much low you can keep your expenses, the higher you will be able to invest in other areas. Determining the budget depends on a lot of factors like the current financial position, allocated funds, existing resources, and the required commodities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The budget of the whole project is made by aggregation of the cost estimates of individual activities, and after totaling all these, a final baseline is set, which is determined as a formal budget until any cost is added or subtracted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the tech industry, the type of developer, as well as the skills possessed, will impact the cost of the project. If the developer is from some other nation, then the nationality of the developer will also affect the budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some agencies ask for <b>hourly pay</b>, and some ask for <b>fixed payment</b>, it is best practice to set the price beforehand and do go over budget. It is good to be upfront about everything so that the whole project can go smoothly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, where would you start looking to find developers?</p>



<p>There are many websites out there which provides you with the service to pick outsourcing company or developers. But here is a list of few popular sites that will get you best results,</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/">GoodFirms</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://www.upwork.com/">UpWork</a></h3>



<p>This is the best platform to get started when it comes to hiring freelancers or agencies for your project. It requires a bit of a learning curve, but you can eventually get the hang of it after a while.</p>



<p>How UpWork works are that when you are required to post your job description and the freelancers will submit their proposal after reading your job description. The massive upside to using UpWork is that it is a paid platform, so freelancers who are severe enough will only submit their proposal to you. This way, you can filter out the skilled developers required for your project. The platform charges <b>10%</b> of the project once it is completed.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer</a></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" width="892" height="405" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/freelancer.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7467" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/freelancer.jpg 892w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/freelancer-768x349.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" /></figure>



<p>Founded in 2009, Freelancer offers multi-level paid partnerships and also an entry-level free membership, which comes with limited features. It provides the most significant marketplace with <b>32 million</b> registered active users on the platform.</p>



<p>The platform is easy to get familiar with, and has a lot of registered, it will be easier for you to go through all profiles and select developer that fits your requirements.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a></h3>



<p>LinkedIn is a network built for professionals and tailored to connect them. In the feed, there is always posting of requirements for various kinds of developers. You can use hashtags like <b>#fullstackdevelopers</b> to find developers you require.</p>



<p>There is also one side benefit that you can see the profile of the Outsourcing agency or the freelancer and decide how they can help you. Taking a look at the background can give you an understanding of how skilled a developer the company is offering. LinkedIn also offers a premium version that will enable you to reach to decision-making authorities like CEO or CTO and connect with them. This can undoubtedly increase your chances of knowing the company better and building a better relationship.</p>



<p>Few things to keep in mind&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Be <b>upfront</b> and <b>transparent</b> about your requirements with the developer, so it is a good practice to hire a developer who is fluent in the same language that you are. This will make the whole communication process go much smoother.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Build a good base for <b>long term relationship</b> with the Outsourcing company or Freelancer. You never know when you might need to work with that company again, so it is best to build a trustworthy relationship beforehand.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Having a <b>backup</b> is a good idea, especially when you are new to hiring from outsourcing companies. If the agency somehow fails to deliver or there is any mishap, your project would go on with the backup.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Do thorough <b>research</b> about the company before you hire them for your project. There are websites out there like <b>GoodFirms</b>, which will give you the details about the company as well as customer reviews to see how they execute the project.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Choose a platform that has <b>payment regulations</b> embedded in it. UpWork is such a platform, and this helps when there is an issue regarding payment, and you need an unbiased judgment.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you are non-technical and have to interview a developer for your project, then ask them to explain their previous projects and how did they solve the obstacles that came during the project duration. Their explanation would help you understand how their mindset is.</li></ul>
