<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">GlassWall Solutions Ltd: Who are they? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GlassWall Solutions Ltd, a UK-based company, is passionate about making the world a safe place by delivering leading cyber-security solutions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GlassWall Solutions has developed innovative, quantum-leap-level security technology that provides unique protection against document-related cyberthreats. Businesses lose around $8,500 per hour due to ransomware-induced downtime. The ransom payment grew by 104%, up to $780,000. However, the worst is damage to reputation. Fortune 500 companies that have fallen victim to attacks have seen their reputations tarnished. It can take years to build credibility and only seconds to destroy it. It’s difficult to put an exact financial impact associated with the reputational loss but a recent study by </span><a href="https://www.centrify.com/media/4772757/ponemon_data_breach_impact_study_uk.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centrify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 65% of consumers lost their trust in an organization after the breach. GlassWall Solutions provides real-time protection, profound inspection, rehabilitation, and cleansing of all possible file threats. GlassWall’s toolings handle documents, PDF, Word, Excel, images, etc. Plus, it is done without the use of detection signatures completely restoring clean, standard-related files while maintaining their full usability.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8195" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ItSvit_GlassWall_map.gif" alt="" width="1900" height="900" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deployment Heaven? Ready, set, go! </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How fast should the service be provided if we talk about the security of the whole system and the whole business? In no time/as fast as possible, of course. GlassWall’s leaders subscribed to this opinion and partnered with IT Svit to analyze their existing deployment process and, if necessary, create a new architecture to make it faster. So, we took the challenge! </span></p>
<p><b>Challenge details: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit of the current stack outlined the key bottlenecks for GlassWall.  An 8-hour, manual, error-prone, and tangled AWS and VMWare ESXi deployment process with an inability to track the changes, their order, and author, which could lead to a lot of confusion. Plus, an application deployment configuration process was obscure and led to significant delivery lag and mounting development costs. </span></p>
<p><b>Our main objective: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of 8-10 weeks,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">design and implement a solution for efficient, automated (one-click) deployment of multiple independent disposable Kubernetes clusters in the scope of AWS cloud using CloudFormation and VMWare ESXi, provide documentation with detailed diagrams, develop the option to automatically assign a static IPv4 address to VMs in VMWare ESXi deployment.</span></p>
<p><b>Our plan:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">           </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach during the development of infrastructure to make change management simple, transparent, clear, and decrease the troubleshooting time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a new AWS and VMWare ESXi infrastructure architecture for fast, automated, and cost-effective deployment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make an automated fleet of single-node, flexible Kubernetes clusters </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be launched in many copies with minimum configuration changes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refactor manifests and helm charts to make the deployment configuration process easier.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement a DHCP server for automated management of IP address leases in the VMWare ESXi environment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support GlassWall’s team with tech documentation. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Our solutions:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is open-source. For the IaC approach realization, we were supposed to utilize the AWS CloudFormation service. How did we pull this off? We used AWS CloudFormation to build an admin VM that can clone Git repo with Terraform code and execute it while the end-user interacts with CloudFormation template UI only. This allows simple dashboard deployment with a single click of a button. Plus, the CloudFormation stack can be shared leveraging one single link which leads users directly to the configuration page. With the configuration finished, users can launch the stack and get a copy of this particular infrastructure on their AWS account. To have a disposable Kubernetes cluster we built a custom AWS AMI. The AWS CloudFormation stack creates an Auto Scaling group from the AMI with k3s service and a Network Load Balancer. The k3s service provides a Kubernetes cluster with a proper public IP address. Therefore lots of independent clusters were launched. Clusters became easily adjustable. Helm charts and other manifests restructuring enabled predictable version changes tracking. With these upgrades in hand, teams spend less time on operations and application management.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For VMWare ESXi infrastructure automated management we developed Terraform manifests from scratch. We were provided with OVA that should be running there. The OVA wasn’t working as expected, so we converted OVA to VMDK and integrated it into the infrastructure we built. Additionally, using Terraform we created a DHCP server, to assign static IP leases to other VMs. Utilizing </span><a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mermaid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an UML diagrams tool that allows defining diagrams in markdown, we made helpful tech documentation for GlassWall’s team to operate the system independently.</span></p>
<p><b>Technologies we used:</b></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8194" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/лого2.jpg" alt="" width="2375" height="1240" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/лого2.jpg 2375w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/лого2-768x401.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/лого2-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/лого2-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2375px) 100vw, 2375px" /></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8191" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stack1624437105612.jpg" alt="" width="1901" height="165" srcset="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stack1624437105612.jpg 1901w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stack1624437105612-768x67.jpg 768w, https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stack1624437105612-1536x133.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1901px) 100vw, 1901px" /></p>
<p><b>Our outcomes:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just 8 weeks, IT Svit came up with the solution for GlassWall that helped them achieve:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Deployment time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decreased from 8 hours to 10 minutes (</span><b>48x faster deployment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Efficiency.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fewer resources (time/costs/employee-hours) are now required as code deployment has moved from a tedious, manual process to a codified, automated mechanism.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Customer satisfaction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rate is significantly increased as GlassWall assists and addresses customer needs much faster and more efficiently now. Plus, GlassWall Solutions are currently able to optimize their performance to further support the greater cyber-security industry.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8199" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Deploy_time.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside these benefits, IT Svit strengthened the GlassWall team’s capabilities of operating well-developed infrastructure within their SDLC. IT Svit’s blueprint for IaC and CI/CD can be replicated amongst engineering teams across the organization. What&#8217;s more, GlassWall can now take advantage of cloud-based development technologies to cut down their data center costs and focus on enhancing AWS cloud development and IaC capabilities. Their product and its infrastructure are now highly available, scalable, and durable, requiring less effort to handle all possible issues. With the GlassWall Solutions Ltd project, we designed and set up architecture to accelerate their deployment velocity at most for GlassWall’s customers to get the best possible services.</span></p>

<p>The customer was able to significantly reduce the complexity of the inner workings of their software. Through deploying the platform consisting of microservices with containerized Docker apps to a Kubernetes cluster running on Terraform on AWS infrastructure, we enabled security, load balancing and auto-scaling of resources. By implementing CI/CD processes, we ensured the customer is able to update various platform components independently and their performance is not affected by other operations. In-depth monitoring ensures the customer’s team keeps a hand on the pulse of the project at all times and the TTR has shortened significantly.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>This project helped IT Svit better understand the inner workings of distributed databases in complex, geographically diverse systems.  We were able to apply our expertise to ensure error-free deployment, updates and maintenance of enterprise-grade video conferencing software used by thousands of people daily.</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/devops-services-for-containerizing-a-web-conferencing-software/">DevOps services for containerizing a web conferencing software</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>The customer had the following project specifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automate Kubernetes cluster deployment to bare metal servers</li>
<li>Automate Kubernetes cluster deployment to AWS</li>
<li>Build resource-segregated AWS stack</li>
<li>Implement and optimize CI/CD pipelines for product updates</li>
<li>Implement monitoring and alerting</li>
</ol>
<h2>Challenges and solutions</h2>
<p>One critical feature of the app is its ability to monitor the system to prevent hacking. Zebitex uses a lot of technologies that conform to the system calls issued by the application. The platform also has a lot of network segregation between different parts of the app to ensure that wallets are not accessing it directly—they have to pass through a proxy before authentication.</p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7797" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zebitex_results.gif" alt="" width="1900" height="645" /></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>IT Svit has prepared Helm charts, Terraform and Kubernetes manifests and various other scripts to enable seamless and error-proof deployment of Kubernetes clusters to bare metal servers and AWS infrastructure. We optimized the system workflows and improved its performance while ensuring the security of operations. We implemented CI/CD pipelines to automate and streamline the delivery of new features and platform operations in production using AWS Lambda, Cognito, API Gateway, RDS, DEX and other tools. Finally, we implemented an in-depth monitoring and smart alerting system to help the customer keep an eye on the platform performance.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Working on Zebitex project enabled the IT Svit team to further improve our mastery with Helm and other tools. We were able to deliver all the required results on time, which helped the customer launch a profitable product and further update it. The main scope of work is done, but the partnership is ongoing and we help Zebitex grow and succeed!</p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/zebitex-aws-infrastructure-configuration-and-optimization-for-a-cryptocurrency-exchange/">Zebitex — AWS infrastructure configuration and optimization for a cryptocurrency exchange</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer wanted IT Svit to deliver various DevOps services:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess the existing AWS infrastructure</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design and implement the failover plan</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide ongoing system support and updates</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges and solutions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infrastructure the customer operates is split into two regions, in Germany and in the US. Both have the test and production environments and run several apps that enable platform functionality. As the product is very popular in Sweden, it is in constant development, so the customer needed us to configure a failsafe CI/CD pipeline for developing and releasing platform updates using AWS resources and services. We also went with optimizing the system performance and reducing the amount of AWS services and resources used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the goals of the project was to move the workloads from Germany to the US to increase the response time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We assessed the existing infrastructure and configured AWS VPC peering to optimize resource allocation. We also moved the production environment to the US and created an Aurora RDS slave replica in the US region. Then we configured AWS CI/CD tools to update both the US and Germany regions simultaneously and replicated the monitoring system from Europe to the US region. We also updated the Varnish deployment to change the endpoint based on the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we prepared detailed developer documentation and are currently providing ongoing project support.</span></p>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7738" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ItSvit_Gastrofy_results-min.gif" alt="" width="1900" height="645" /></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By properly configuring AWS services and restructuring the system, we helped the customer reduce the expenses on infrastructure maintenance, shorten time-to-market for the platform updates and new features and increase overall cost-efficiency of the operations.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Svit has proven its in-depth expertise with AWS products and services once more. We helped the leading Swedish meal planning and online grocery platform become more cost-efficient, deliver uninterrupted positive end-user experience and drive more value to their customers.</span></p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/infrastructure-optimization-for-online-meal-planning-platform/">Infrastructure Optimization for Online Meal Planning platform</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer required in-depth DevOps expertise to optimize the existing infrastructure and workflows, automate testing and deployment of the new platform features and integrate multiple external tools and services. The ultimate goal was migrating the legacy infrastructure to AWS and ensuring its ultimate cost-efficiency</span></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technologies and libraries of object PHP are actively used in developing the main platform at the server and backend application level. We use MS SQL Server, Redshift, ElasticSearch and the Lambda architecture at the database storage organization level, using Node.js as the basic technology. Stored procedures, functions, etc. from the databases are actively used, as part of the logic is shifted specifically to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the working databases, all large accounts and posts for all key social networks are collected and aggregated, with a capacity from hundreds of gigabytes to dozens of terabytes. Search is built on ElasticSearch 6 and consists of 7-8 indexes which contain more than 1 TB of data each and is still growing. A lot of work was done with third-party APIs: Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Pinterest (and new ones are added regularly).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started integration with IBM Watson AI services and API. In the daily routine of organizing and automating Agile SDLC processes, we use GitLab, Jenkins, automating Continuous Integration + Continuous Deployment practices and consistently implementing the Continuous Delivery concept. We prepared the infrastructure for the implementation and coverage of new feature functionality with automated tests. In the near future, we plan to cover the entire platform code with unit, integration and performance tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main application hosting is located in Amazon Cloud using its services (S3, Route53, CloudFront and many more).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The back-end is a Laravel API. The database is MS SQL, where stored procedures, functions, etc. are actively used. The database contains all the major accounts for all key social networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work through Git to consistently implement Continuous Integration + Continuous Deployment. We use AWS Lambda through working with Node.js.</span></p>

<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer had the following project specifications:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online video conferencing should work directly from the browser without any additional software or extensions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature should support mobile devices, as well as multiple desktop platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several core features should include screen sharing, chat, audio muting, speaker highlighting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system should provide automatic recovery on disconnection and easily switch between WiFi and 3G/4G/5G/LTE</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User-friendly interface</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature should enable meeting recording and replayability</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges and solutions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to build this application using a peer-to-peer approach when all the call participants have equal rights and share the resource workload, without anybody having to support a dedicated server for video streaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest challenge encountered was building a platform for stable connectivity. We developed a specific component for client applications enabling them to switch to alternative Internet access routes with minimum connection disruption. This enabled seamless switching between WiFi and mobile Internet access for mobile devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad Internet connection was a big issue even for web app performance. On the testing stage, some users experienced connectivity issues during their calls even on desktop devices with landline Internet connections. A built-in WebRTC feature constantly monitors the connection performance and lowers the bitrate of video/audio streams automatically if the connection becomes worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turned out that Safari on iOS does not support RTCDataChannel, so we had to use web socket technology for arbitrary data transfer. This allowed us to enable the system to work even with Safari just as well as with all other browsers.</span></p>
<h2><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7669" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Results.gif" alt="" width="1900" height="645" /></h2>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We integrated video calls into Hurma in a timely manner using our previous developments in this area. The ability to call anyone anytime directly from the browser has significantly simplified communication for recruiters, candidates, employees and HR managers. In addition, the ability to record all the calls (after the explicit consent) enabled the HR/recruiting specialists to replay any call later on. </span></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The peer-to-peer approach helped us minimize resource consumption, as the main flow of data goes between clients, not from clients to a server. A simple API of the video conferencing system allowed us to easily customize UI to meet customer requirements for various cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Svit has proven its DevOps, Python development and software integration expertise once more, providing a simple and reliable tool for online communications directly from a browser.</span></p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/online-meeting-functionality-for-hurma/">Online meeting functionality for Hurma</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer required the following services:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a multi-cloud architecture for running containerized blockchain nodes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Containerize all cryptocurrency apps running in the system</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure a Kubernetes cluster to run EOS and deploy all the pods/services/deployments prepared</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure Multi-Availability-Zone deployments within a single AWS region with High Availability within that region</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enable minute monitoring of system performance</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Challenges and solutions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While working on this project, we had to solve several challenges:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensuring fault tolerance with minimal downtime for all blockchains supported</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This had to be done for Tendermint blockchains — Cosmos, Terra, Iris, etc. We needed to ensure only one block producer is active at any given time and the downtime between spinning up different producers is minimal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — We deployed the system in 2 regions with the same infrastructure and launched a HashiCorp Consul server tracking the state of the active region. This enabled monitoring the platform performance, and if any issues arise in one region, the producer is stopped in one region and launched in the other.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensuring an automated system failover and data recovery</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is a possibility that blockchain podes will remain offline long enough for the blocks to be completed with errors. In this case, we need to evaluate the data relevance and replace the outdated blocks with the relevant data from the backups in another region.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— we enabled separate pode backups for every region and created a script checking the timestamp of the last file update.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensuring continuity of operations and automated bans for blockchains after 30 minutes out of consensus</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Due to the fact that Tendermint blockchains produce blocks very quickly (once every 6-7 seconds), we need to be informed within 1-2 minutes if the blockchain is out of consensus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— All logs are monitored with Log exporter, alerts are sent to Alert Manager in Prometheus and we are able to react very quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Automated checks for new blockchain versions and building Docker images for them</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We need to build the blockchain applications using the latest stable version, after checking the source code and the installed packages for security vulnerabilities. We must also ensure the apps are not launched from under the root user.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— We solved this by configuring 2 Jenkins jobs. The first job checks for new blockchain app version, the second one builds a new image after testing the code and packages for vulnerabilities. When the image is updated, the second job sends a notification to Slack.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Enabling real-time two-level monitoring.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We needed to ensure nobody was able to mishandle the blockchain apps, which meant the need to implement an in-depth monitoring solution capable of instantly alerting of any suspicious activity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— We use Falco and custom rules to monitor external container access attempts or incorrect node behavior</span><b>.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Implementing robust user authentication and access rights configuration. </b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to ensure there is no way any Kubernetes cluster pod is able to access the cloud provider’s resources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Solution </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— We used kiam (Kubernetes Identity &amp; Access Management) agents to configure limited access rights assigned to each individual pod.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="Lazy" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7635" src="https://itsvit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Staked-ResultsMIN.gif" alt="" width="1900" height="645" /></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Svit team was able to configure the multi-cloud architecture able to run on AWS resources, IBM Cloud and Google Cloud Platform. We’re running and maintaining  the following blockchains so far:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algorand     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmos     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dash     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decred    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EOS    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EOS CryptoKylin    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factom on production    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factom on staging     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris    </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livepeer     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana     </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tezos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ecosystem is built leveraging Kubernetes autoscaling and auto-healing features including load balancing and failover to several geographically distributed regions. It has enabled robust CI/CD implementation and new blockchain version rollout automation. Infrastructure as Code approach has empowered the speed of the new blockchains onboarding from weeks at the start to hours now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-depth two-level real-time monitoring leveraging Sumologic, Prometheus, Grafana, Sysdig and Falco saves us a lot of time and effort for tracing and nailing issues down, as well as raises team awareness about relevant blockchain states. As a result, the system elastically scales up to handle heavy workloads, keeps a high quality of service and improves platform popularity.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to having precise project requirements, the IT Svit team was able to provide all the deliverables on time. Once the first set of blockchain apps was containerized and the monitoring implemented, the only remaining challenge was to add new cryptocurrency to the system as quickly as it was available according to the customer needs.</span></p>The post <a href="https://itsvit.com/cases/kubernetes-cloud-architecture-consultancy-for-blockchain-startup/">Kubernetes & cloud architecture consultancy for blockchain startup</a> first appeared on <a href="https://itsvit.com">IT Svit</a>.]]></content:encoded>
